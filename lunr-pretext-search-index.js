  "body": " What is this?  I've been trying to work my way though \"Conceptual Mathematics\" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein \"L&S\") on my own and it's been kind of difficult. Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not. In an effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.  With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with PreTeXt . I've done a lot of work using latex for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering diagrams with the TiKz package.  To start, I went through my old notes on L&S from my first attempted reading. It looks like I made to to around session 11 before I started really getting lost. Furthermore, the erasable ink I had used to solve the exercises originally had faded significantly since I originally worked on this. Since I'm expecting one of my major difficulties with this to be recreating the diagrams, I figured restarting from the very beginning would be the best way forward.  I know myself better than to make promises about the rate I get through this, but part of me thinks it would be fun to do \"cat theory on caturday\". Giving myself a day of the week to finish by might give me the push I need to get it done. Besides, everything is better with cats.  "

I'm presuming the reader has access to the source material and hope that my abbreviated reproduction of the prompts this way is \"fair use\". After all, calling them \"exercises\" implies they're meant for me to work out, no?   Exercise 1:   \"...other examples of combining two objects to get a third...\"    Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps might satisfy the pattern here. The way my cats seem to behave is based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the \"maps\".  The diagrams in session 1 had the following structure:   A typical diagram of the examples considered in L&S \"Session 1\"      It didn't really make sense to me to think of \"behavior\" as A in this diagram and nature\/nuture as B\/C because I could think of many situations where a single behavior might make sense in different environments. It seems more natural to think of behavior as function of environment rather than the environment as a function of the behavior. I feel like the qualities I identified might more accurately be arranged like so:   Alternate explanation structure of behavior (A), nature (B), and nurture (C)      I think some of this unease comes from the complexity associated with behavior. I think on some level I'm confusing a \"behavioral genotype\" with a \"behavioral phenotype\". Being a cat creates a behavior profile of the actions they might engage in, but the environment selects for which actions are allowed to manifest.  Let's define as \"the set of animals\". We can consider \"instincts\" as a map that maps each animal to its \"natural behavior profile\" in set B. We can also consider \"selection\" as a map that maps each animal to an \"environmental reward profile\" in set C. Under these definitions, it seems reasonable to think of the composite map (or ) producing an \"observed behavior profile\" in set D.   Full diagram of behavior expression as maps.      As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats \"playing with toys\". Given that they are cats, I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result. However, I also restrict their environment so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey. What we percieve as \"playing\" is really a proxy for murderous insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.  I think I can see how this additional structure helped to clarify what had started as an vague idea. It makes a lot more sense to think of mapping from a specific cat to a behavior profile, than trying to map from a cat's behavior profile to a specific environment.     Exercise 2:   \"...describe an experiment for deciding whether two nearby points are at the same level...\"    I feel there's an obvious answer to this question: a level. By using a bit of water in a clear container, you could convievably build a rudamentary level by comparing the slant of the water against a marked line. The only tricky part is designing it so you could align it with the points you want to compare, but the basic idea is that if the points are level then the water wouldn't tilt. The authors' use of the word \"level\" in the prompt makes me think they were heavily leading the reader towards something like this. A level makes it easy to hang pictures expressly because it removes the need to measure up from the floor.    "

  "title": "Article 1: Sets, maps, composition",
  "body": " Article 1: Sets, maps, composition  This is technically my second time through this content and I think I made some errors in my original solutions to exercises 2-5. Rather than ignore my mistakes, I've made the decision to recreate them here and explain why I think I was wrong afterward. I hope this method will give more insight into my thought process. To prevent accidental spoilers, this will be treated as a \"Hidden Exercise 10\".   Exercise 1:   \"...understand how we got diagrams...\"    Okay let's start by recreating diagram (i).   The original associative law diagram (i) from L&S Article 1.      For diagram (iv), we drop set C and connect B directly to D.   Completed associative law diagram (iv) from L&S Article 1.      To get from here to diagram (v), we drop set B and connect A directly to D.   Completed associative law diagram (v) from L&S Article 1.      As expected, this diagram is an exact match of diagram (iii).     Exercise 2   How many different maps are there with domain and codomain ?...    So I approached this like I would an algebraic function like , but instead of feeding in a number I'm feeding in John ( ), Mary ( ) or Sam ( ) and getting out a breakfast order at a diner that only serves eggs ( ) or coffee ( ) and has a 1 item limit per order.  I know that the number of outcomes is going to be the same for each person, so it made sense to focus on one person at a time. I imagined John's breakfast order, , as having 3 possible outcomes.   John orders eggs:  John orders coffee:  John fails to place an order at all: is undefined   Likewise, Mary and Sam have the same 3 possible outcomes: {eggs,coffee,undefined}. Since these events are independent of each other, the total number of possible outcomes is maps in total.     Exercise 3   Same, but for maps     I thought of this function like the \"favorite person\" map example from the reading. Using John as an example, I imagined 4 possible character roles in a hypothetical Hollywood love triangle:   John is in love with Mary.  John is in love with Sam.  John is a narcissist, in love with himself:  John is a psychopath, incapable of love: is undefined   Given an analogous set of 4 outcomes for Mary and Sam, the total number of possible plot outcomes is .     Exercise 4   Same, but for maps     I imagined this one as a \"mystery breakfast order\". I'm the a waiter in a diner delivering one order of eggs and one order of coffee to a table where John, Mary, and Sam are seated. The map tells me who ordered a given dish. Like before, I'll consider one example at a time. There are 4 possible outcomes for the source of the eggs:   John ordered the eggs:  Mary ordered the eggs:  Sam ordered the eggs:  Nobody ordered eggs: is undefined   Since there must likewise be 4 sources for the coffee, the total number of possible outcomes is .     Exercise 5   Same, but for maps     At this point I had observed a pattern and attempted to generalize. Following my reasoning from exercises 2-4, I notice all my answers fit a pattern:   In exercise 5, the size of the domain and codmain would each be 2. Evaluating the expression above gives us possible maps.     Exercise 6   How many maps satisfy ?    This is where I started to notice some problems with my previous reasoning. In order for me to talk about the properties of , it didn't make sense for to be \"undefined\" for an element in my domain. If I didn't get something \"out\", I wouldn't be able to feed it back in. So instead of considering all possible \"love triangles\" I identified earlier, I could narrow my search down to a more limited set of maps by excluding the \"psychopaths\" from my romance movies because they make it impossible to produce a sequel (more on that idea later).  This narrowed my search, but 27 is still too many for me too sort out by hand so I started looking for ways to break it down further. I knew I could satisfy the constraint with the identity map because clearly . I also know I could satisfy with a \"constant function\" such as the following:  Furthermore, there would need to be a total of 3 such \"constant functions\" because you'd need one for each of the 3 possible destinations. At that point it seemed clear I was still missing some. If I could construct a function with 1 arrow to each point and also a function with 3 arrows to a single point, it seemed reasonable to assume there'd be a class of maps with 2 arrows leading to a single point.  Let's consider the case where that point with two arrows leading in to be \"John\". One of the arrows leading to John has to be from himself for to be true, but the other arrow could originate at either Mary or Sam. Given these two possible maps exist for each person, we'd have maps of this type.  Putting everything together, some patterns seem to emerge when I listed these out in a table using binomials.     number of fixed points  number of maps  as binomial    1  3     2  6     3  1      Adding up all of these up gives us total of possible maps.     Exercise 7   How many maps satisfy ?    This was made even easier by the pattern I noticed in the previous example. Given that there are only two elements in the domain, there are maps with 1 fixed point and map with 2 fixed points (namely, ) for total of .     Exercise 8   ... for which ?...    None? B has fewer choices in it than A, so when f maps from A to B it must destroy at least one of them. The map g would not be able to produce 3 outputs from only 2 inputs, so there's no possible way for the composition to cover all elements of A.     Exercise 9   ... for which ?...    I started here by considering a blank diagram that would fit the composition, and start filling it in one point at a time.   Empty diagram for      Since I know each point has to end up back where it started, the only real \"choice\" is which of the 3 middle points the path goes through.   Diagram of potential paths for first point in      Once I fix the first path, the next point only has two possible intermediary points that it can go through.   Diagram of potential paths for second point in      Given that there were 3 choices for the first path and 2 choices for the second, there's a total of paths altogether.  This also makes sense as the binomial , because we have 3 possible intermediary points and we need to choose 2 of them.     Exercise 10   [hidden]    What first clued me in that my answers to exercises 2-5 might be wrong was the hint about \"BOOKKEEPING rules\" at the very end of the section. Looking back, it's seem like my programming background may have clouded my understanding of \"map\".  I was thinking about a \"map\" like I would a \"function\" in a program. In this analogy I had interpreted \"domain\" as my \"input type\" and \"codomain\" as \"output type\". The flaw in this reasoning is that I was allowing \"functions\" to \"error\", which is not true under the definitions of \"map\" and \"domain\" that were presented. If the map produced something \"undefined\", it would be inaccurate to include in the domain of to begin with.  This means that the generalized formula I came up with earlier is \"off by 1\", and the corrected formula should be as follows:   Under these revised definitions, the answers to excercises 2-5 should be as follows:     Excercise  Size of domain  Size of codomain  Expression  Result    2  3  2  2^3  8    3  3  3  3^3  27    4  2  3  3^2  9    5  2  2  2^2  4     I can see why these definitions simplify the process of talking about \"bookkeeping\" for the number maps. It's much easier to count the maps if we limit ourselves to the ones that are well-formed to start with. I'm left wondering if there's a situation where having an \"undefined\" output token like I used might be a useful construct, but the costs seem to far outweigh the benefits.  I can also see some programming parallels here between the \"switch\" statement in C-like languages and the \"match\" statement in Rust. The Rust compiler goes an extra step to verify that every possible outcome has been handled before even attempting to complile the code you give it. This provides an extra level of assurance that these functions will behave as expected.    "

It seems so natural to want a symbol for \"number of elements\".  For present, I suppose I'll follow the book's convention and save myself two extra characters.

  "body": " Article 2: Isomorphisms, Part 1  Time to undo things! I think I'm coming into this section with a decent grasp of what an isomorphism is already, but this idea that there are two inverses instead of just one still feels a little weird to me. I find myself reminding myself that this something I already do, but now I'm just being more specific with my language.  If teaching has taught me anything, it's that people sometimes have very different ideas about what is meant by seemingly simple phrases like \"the opposite of two\". It's often too easy to fall into a trap in assuming that since I'm thinking of two as a position on the number line and the opposite of that is defined relative to the origin, but \"negative two\" is really only one possible answer. If the question \"what's the oppositve of two?\" had beem asked in the kitchen instead of a math class, there's a case to be made that \"one half\" is actually the more appropriate response. The opposite of doubling a recipe is halving one. There might even be situations where it may be helpful to think of \"opposite\" as both the reciprocal and negation, as you would with slopes of perpendicular lines.  For now, I think I need to be paying attention to the domains and codomains of the maps because that's where I was getting tripped up earlier.   Exercise 1   Show that...is an isomorphism.    For the reflexive property (R), we can note that acts as it's own inverse. Since it leaves every object in place, applying it a second time would also do nothing so .

For most intents and purposes, we should have but the domain and codomain don't look right here. Specifically, we have a problem where is undefined and another problem where for . Based on these observations, I'd have to conclude that is not invertable.   Having still not entirely convinced myself these are correct, I thought it might be helpful to look at the graphs. I started with the first pair to make sure its what I expected.   Comparison of graphs for Article II, Exercise 4.1      One of the way's I think of my inverse function is as \"a reflection over the line \". This works nicely for a visual confirmation because I can tell that this relationship will hold for the rest of the lines. My confidence in being invertible is very high.  Now let's take a look at the relation between and :   Comparison of graphs for Article II, Exercise 4.2-4.4      Notice how the inverse function only replicates half of the parabola when reflected over the diagonal. My justification for thinking that (2) is an isomorphism but (3) and (4) are not is that every point in the domain needs to have an inverse that these can be matched up with a point in the codomain (both \"onto\" and \"one-to-one\"). By including negative numbers in our domain, we're essentially allowing un-invertable points to be passed in.  Now let's take a look at the final functions:   Comparison of graphs for Article II, Exercise 4.5      On the surface, this looks like precisely the function we're looking for. It looks like a pretty good \"mirror image\". The problem comes when consider the domain and codomain. The map is only valid for positive values, so let's crop and zoom in our previous graph.   Cropped and zoomed graph for Article II, Exercise 4.5      Notice how the graph of seemingly has an asymptote at and gets \"cut-off\" when it hits the x-axis. For us to consider this as an inverse map, the domain of the inverse should match the codomain of the map and vice versa. Even though these maps meet my reflection criteria, the fact that is undefined for and when domain and codomain are supposed to both be disqualifies it from being considered an inverse to the map .  Perhaps what I should really be doing is looking at the compositions. We can express as or we can express as . These expressions both simplify to just , but the holes left in the map when we divide by zero at or don't just disappear.    While I'm in the process of undo-ing things, I need to work on undo-ing my tendancy to rush things like this. I need to remind myself that learing this stuff isn't a race. I'm going to use the subdivisions in Article II to break this up into smaller sections so I can give it more time to sink in.  "

It doesn't matter if we're assigning Fatima to or , it's precisely the same number of choices.

However, this is not the same as , which evaluates to instead.  The map in (b) and the map in (c) are both closely related because they share a common definition of , but differ in the domain and codomain.  Again there's an obvious inverse function of \"square root\", but the domains and codomains are what concern me. Notable about (b) is that it fails to map \"onto\" the entire codomain, because the map never produces any negative numbers as an output. The map in (c) resolves this by limiting the codomain to non-negative values, but it still fails to \"one-to-one\" because both 1 and -1 produce an output of 1.  The map in (d) and (e) likewise have similar definitions.  The map defined by the given expression acts as its own inverse: . Where (d) and (e) differ is in the \"combining-rule\".

The map in (e) fails to uphold the combining rule because . In the case where and , we have but .  Finally we have the map (f), which isn't even a map with the specified domain and codomain because the cube of a negative number is still negative. Had the map been defined with the correct codomain, , then we'd potentially be able to define an inverse map by using the \"cube root\" function.    As I was proof reading this session, I noticed a couple small errors in the 3rd exercise. One of these was a misread problem, but the other was a little more subtle. In an effort to get the most out of this as a learning experience, I thought it might be valuable to talk about what I learned from my mistakes.   Meta-Exercise   As I was proof reading, I noticed an error in Exercise 3 Part (e). It was a simple case of me not reading the question as precisely as needed. I think I was so excited to show (d) was an isomorphism that I didn't give (e) the amount of skepticism it deserved. I mistakely read the domain as instead of which made finding a counter-example trivial relative to the actual problem.  As I was looking over my solution to fix this, I noticed something else kind of odd. My solution began with \"Let's go one at a time\" but I had addressed some of the problems in pairs. There's something that felt natural about approaching them this way, but it also seemed kind of ironic that I had failed to produce a isomorphism between my problems and solutions in a section that was all about matching things up.  All of this started to get my thinking about the solutions to these problems as a map . Obviously this map is not invertable, but it made me wonder if the \"Hints\" to this section provided sufficient information about the functions to identify each one. Is there some set of descriptions that would establish a one-to-one relationship with these problems?    The first hint tells us that only one of these maps is a \"genuine isomorphism\", which I concluded was (d). The last hint says that one is \"not even a map\", which I concluded is (f). The hint that \"[s]ome... dont respect the combining rules\" explains why I rejected (a) and (e). It also seems natural to ask \"does it have a section?\" and \"does it have a retraction?\".

Okay, yeah, that's partly because I'm lazy, but I think it's also a good metaphor for what I learned about this week. Writing these posts is a multi-stage process that resembles a sequence of map compositions. I read (at least some of) the section, work out the exercises, then come back and revise. What you see at the end is the composition, but not necessarily each step along the way. At the same time, some qualities of the end product itself may restrict the process leading to it but others leave flexibility.  This week's reading seemed to be about exactly how flexible these maps could be before they start to lose information.  I could have removed the remark at the start of this and replaced it with something else. Yet, the fact that I'm now discussing it means it must be there.  This seems exceptionally well fitting to how my proofs this week worked. I'm essentially arguing that these maps exists because I can describe a set of rules to construct them. Whether you believe me or not, well, that's another story...  "

  "body": " Session 6: Two general aspects or uses of maps  This week's reading didn't have any official exercises in it, but it also seemed important so I wanted to make sure I gave it the same level of attention as the others. I find that I need to continually reminding myself that math is not a race and that I should take advantage of current privilege to truly take things slow here. My purpose isn't to get through the excercises in this book; it's to understand the deeper ideas behind it.  This session is filled with beautiful mathematical writing.  I think math courses need more content like this. At the same time, both the student and teacher in me recognize that this is one of the first things that would be cut from the syllabus if the class ran short on time. It makes me sad that our system's focus on measurable learning objectives means that philosophical discussions are treated as dispensible.  In much the same way as the authors describe science as maps being used to understand reality, the education system uses assessments to understand what's going on inside a student's head. Since we can't observe someone's state of mind, we alter their environment stimuli and see how they respond. This presents problems when we're using map composition to turn one of many complex mental models down to a multiple choice question for the exam. As long as a student could distinguish between \"sort\" and \"partition\" by the end of this unit, we don't really care how it impacted their broader understanding of world around them.  I think there's a hidden exercise in this session. I'll mark it as an example here so you can avoid spoilers if desired.   Session 6 Hidden Exercise   What do you notice? What do you wonder?    After reading through this session, I noticed something very interesting about the last diagram. I'll recreate it here for reference.   The last diagram in L&S Session 6      What struck me as interesting about this map was how closely it described a book . There's only a finite number of \"words\" in the \"language\" that the book is written using, and we can index them with positive integers describing their sequence in the book.  This observation struck me as interesting because my reading of this book works the same as the sampling process. You could generate a map from time to the index of the word that I'm reading at the time, and compose this map with the book map to find out what word I'm reading. This would reveal my non-linear path through the book, rereading sections as needed to answer the problems I'm working on.  It makes me wonder if this session is actually an exercise in meta-mathematics . Maybe the reason the authors intended to sow seeds of curiousity about their ommission and for me look at the book as a system that can be studied using category theory itself. The chapters of the book act as a sort for the exercises, but the fact that this chapter doesn't exercises have any means it's not a partition .

  "body": " Session 7: Isomorphisms and coordinates  It turns out that last week's lack of exercises wasn't as much of an anomaly as I thought it was. After realizing that this week's session didn't have any exercises either, I scanned ahead and noticed that there are several sessions like this before eventually reaching a \"Quiz\" and \"Test\". I'm not sure how I plan to handle those yet, but I think I'm going to keep with my chill pace for now. This session did include several side questions throughout that I can treat as I would the exercises.   Aside 1   What, approximately, is for the point in the picture?    I took a modern approach and used technology to provide a more accurate estimation.    I began by holding the page as flat as I could while taking a photo with my phone and uploaded to the cloud.    I downloaded this photo from my PC and opened it in GIMP .    I used the cursor to identify the following coordinates in pixels: , , , .    Next I calculated the distances from to and from to . Specifically, and .    With this information in hand, I can set up a ratio to determine . Solving results in a solution of .    This seems like a reasonable estimate based on the diagram.     Aside 2   What are the choice of origin, positive direction, and unit of 'distance' involved in specifying this isomorphism?...    Oooh this is a fun one! Let's presume we meet some alien species and are trying to sync up our timelines. We're going to need both space and time coordinates if we really want to do this right. One possibility is for both parties to use \"the big bang\" as a point of origin and \"the light cone\" for a direction and magnitude. This choice makes converting easy, but potentially imprecise because of the sheer size of those values.  A much more practical approach would be to use the meeting time and location as a point of origin, use physical constants to communicate SI units, then work backwards to calculate the local time for each party using a Lorentz transformation. We'd just need to where they came from and how fast they traveled to convert their home civilization's time to their current time.  I think the point that the authors were trying to communicate was that our choice of units and magnitude for \"time\" are very specific to our origin on planet Earth. If we're talking about units of \"years\" as being \"one orbit around the Sun\" and the origin as a socially defined \"common era\", then an alien race from another plant would likely have totally different system of dating then us. However, most SI units are based on physical properties of our universe. Even if this species chose a different set of base units than us, we could match up measurements of certain elements to develop an isomorphism between our two systems.     Aside 3   ...rational explanation for the curious bracketing...    The first thing that jumps out at me about the bracket is that the sums of the adjacent ranks are constant:   8 Player Bracket from L&S Session 7      In other words, the best player is alway paired with the worst player, the next best with the next worst, and so on until all pairs have been assigned.

Let's presume we meet some alien species and are trying to sync up our timelines. We're going to need both space and time coordinates if we really want to do this right. One possibility is for both parties to use \"the big bang\" as a point of origin and \"the light cone\" for a direction and magnitude. This choice makes converting easy, but potentially imprecise because of the sheer size of those values.  A much more practical approach would be to use the meeting time and location as a point of origin, use physical constants to communicate SI units, then work backwards to calculate the local time for each party using a Lorentz transformation. We'd just need to where they came from and how fast they traveled to convert their home civilization's time to their current time.  I think the point that the authors were trying to communicate was that our choice of units and magnitude for \"time\" are very specific to our origin on planet Earth. If we're talking about units of \"years\" as being \"one orbit around the Sun\" and the origin as a socially defined \"common era\", then an alien race from another plant would likely have totally different system of dating then us. However, most SI units are based on physical properties of our universe. Even if this species chose a different set of base units than us, we could match up measurements of certain elements to develop an isomorphism between our two systems.   "

  "body": " Quiz  Since the following section is entitled \"How to solve the quiz problems\", I'm interpreting that as a sign that answering these problems publicly like this is acceptable use. My time as a teacher has taught me that the primary distinction betweeen formatitve and summative assessments lies in how you use them, and this quiz seems to be treated like the former. The goal is to provide students with a self-check on important concepts before the first \"test\".  As I'm still trying to force myself to slow down, my plan for time being is to take the quiz this week and self-grade my own work next week before attempting the \"test\" the week after. I feel as though posting test solutions online would be poor form, so I think I'm going to put my test solutions in a separate PretextBook that can be shared on a per person basis to anyone that's willing to help determine the correctness of my work. We'll see how that goes in the future, but for now we focus on the problems at hand.   Problem 1   Give an example of two explicit sets...    I know this may be a little regressive of me, but I found it easier to think of this problems in terms of \"onto\" and \"one-to-one\". Since I'm looking for a map that \"has a section but not a retraction\", that effectively means the map is \"one-to-one but not onto\". My insticts about functions tell me that this occurs when my \"output space\" is bigger than my \"input space\".  Consider the sets and , and define by the following internal diagram:   Internal diagram of our potential map      To demonstrate that this map has the required properties, let's start by identifying the retraction :   Internal diagram of retraction to our potential map      Proving this is a retraction requires that we show . Fortunately this proof is trivial since there's only one element in for us to test. Since is the only possible input, the fact that is sufficient to satisfy the condition . Thus, is a retraction of .  Note that this map does not function as a section because . This can be easily observed by applying the composition to point : . In order for a map to be a section of , it needs to send point to something other than , but there isn't anywhere else for it to go!   Internal diagram demonstrating the lack of section for our potential map      Since we lose an element when mapping from , there's no way to reconstruct it afterwards. It follows that cannot possibly have a section satisfying . This completes the proof that satistfies the desired properties.     Problem 2   If satisfy ...    Recall that a map is \"idempotent\" if . Thus, we'll take the maps defined in (a) and (b) and see how they might be simplified after being applied twice.  Let's start with (a): . Composing this map with itself gives us , which can be simplified using the associative property:     Having demonstrated that , we can safely conlude that the map in part (a) is idempotent.  We can apply the same strategy in (b) with the expression :     Since , we can conclude that the map in (b) is idempotent as well.     Problem 2*   ...use the given maps and to devise a map satisfying both...    My gut instict tells me because that's the simpliest map I can construct that will have the requisite domain and codomain. Let's check to see if it has the desired properties.  First, we'll look at (a) by seeing if . Using only the associative property, we can simplify the left hand side as follows:      That confirms property (a). We can use a similar method to demonstrate property (b): .        Thus, our choice of has both of the required properties.     Problem 1*   Same as Problem 1 at top of page, except...    Upon reading this problem, it sounded very similar to one of the situations in the \"zoo\" from Session 4. Specifically, I was thinking of the map in Exercise 3 Item (c) where is given by . On closer inspection, my notes from that section indicate that this had a section but no retraction -- which is the reverse of what I'm looking for here. I played around with item (a) from the zoo for a bit, but I wasn't quite happy with how the domains and codomains weren't aligning. This got me thinking about a clue at the end of Session 9. Specifically, the authors mention \"Georg Cantor\" by name.  With the realization that I could use infinite sets of varying sizes, I decided that I could combine this notion with the ideas behind the set sizes in Problem 1 by making a map from a \"countably infinite set\" to an \"uncountably infinite set\". In this situation, I could theoretically use Cantor's diagonalization argument to prove the non-existance of my section.  I decided to use a \"binary representation\" map that takes each positive integer and turns it into a binary representation of a real number between 0 and 1 by prepending \"0.\" to the reversed binary representation of the integer. Like so:     x in base 10  x in base 2  f(x) in base 2    1  1  0.1    2  10  0.01    3  11  0.11    4  100  0.001    ...  ...  ...     We can construct a map that iterates along the digits of the input and sums up the product of that digit with the respective powers of 2. For example, could be evaluated as follows:    Assuming we started with some positive integer and applied to it, it would be in the table above and this map will return the number we started with. Thus we have a well defined retraction becaues . However, Cantor's diagonal argument suggest that there still exists at least one real number in the interval (0,1) for which there is no inverse. Consider the real number constructed by taking a single \"bit\" from each line of the table following the diagonal and flipping it while adding trailing zeroes to the right as needed:     x in base 10  x in base 2  f(x) in base 2  \"flipped\" bit    1  1  0. 1  0    2  10  0.0 1  0    3  11  0.11 0  1    4  100  0.001 0  1    ...  ...  ...     By concatenating all these flipped bits together we can constuct a number given by the binary expansion \"0.0011...\" as defined above. This number doesn't have a corresponding value in the table for because it differs from every output by at least one bit. Since is undefined, we have . The uniqueness of the inverses we proved in Article 2 implies that the section couldn't be anything other than the retraction , so we must conlude that does not have section.    "

  "body": " Brouwer's theorems  It felt like there was a lot of new information introduce here for the session that concludes \"Part II\". This reminds me of my undergraduate research study where I had my first crash course in topology. In fact, flipping back to the start of book reveals the following warning: \"Exceptionally, Session 10 is intended to give the reader a taste of more sophisticated applications; mastery of it is not essential for the rest of the book.\"  As I was reading this week, I also felt reminded of Problem 1* from the Quiz. This idea that we can compare the size of infinite sets like and using the language of retractions seems analagous to the formalation of Brouwer's theorems. I'm expecting the proofs in this section to follow a similar format, even though this notion of a \"continuous maps\" seems a little informal at the moment.   Exercise 1:   Let be, as before, the inclusion of the circle into the disk...    We're given that we have two continuous maps and that . We want to show that there's some point such that We're also told to use the retraction theorem , and the revelevant one states that \"there is no continuous map which is a retraction for j\".  Let's suppose for a second that the opposite were true: for every . Since these two points are different, we can construct an arrow using one of them as the \"tail\" and one as the \"head\". We can define a map that follows this arrow until it reaches the boundary point on the circle like so:   Construction diagram for our map      Since we're guaranteed to have , let's see what happens when we compose with it. If we could prove , we'd have a contradiction and be done, but it's not clear that's the case quite yet. I think the key to this lies in the fact that . In the text, they proved the special case where . This is a slightly more relaxation condition to show that doesn't need to be the identity everywhere it just needs to be the identity on the edge of the disk where it meets the circle.  I'm thinking of like taking a sample from the embedding of rather than from at large. The text used the notation to show this operation. Once we've chosen that , we can apply the map to aquire our point on the edge of the disk.  Since , the rule that still applies, but if we force to be the \"head\" of the arrow then we'll have an arrow whose \"head\" lies on the boundary, which also happens to be the same point we originated from.   Construction diagram for our map      Being able to follow the points back to their origins like this essentially gives us a retraction for . However, we already know such retraction can't exist! This means that our assumption that is false, which is logically equivalent to the assertion that . QED.  I must admint, this all feels a little \"hand wavy\" still. I'm not really sure how much of Euclidean geometry I'm projecting onto the situation. I think this is also a good spot to point out the \"antipodal\" map that we'd get by swapping the head and tail of our arrow between and :   Construction diagram for our antipodal map      I'd expect this map to have some fun properties. The one situation where we'd have an endomap on the circle with no fixed points is the one that maps each point to the one opposite it, but this needs a fixed point for us to reflect over. I think this is going to be important later.     Exercise 2:   Suppose is a 'retract' of ...    Let's sort through our givens here. We know we have with . We also know that has a fixed point property: for every endomap there exists some with . We want to show that has the same property for maps from .  Let's start by having a look at the class of endomaps . Each map must have some corresponding map given by . We can apply on the left and on the right to get an equivalent expresson for in terms of :      Since this map has some fixed point such that , there must be some corresponding point in given by that has this property for . It should then follow that is a fixed point of satisfying.         Having proven that , we've established our fixed point property and I think we're done.     Exercise 3:   Use the result of the preceeding exercise, ...    Let's recap the last exercise: Given \"A is a retract of X\" ( ) and \"X has the fixed point property for maps from T\" ( such that ), it follows that \"A also has the fixed point property\" ( such that ).  In the case of theorem (1), we can assume the premise \"Let be a line segment including its endpoints ( for Interval) and suppose is a continuous endomap. Then must have a fixed point: a point in for which .\"  We're attempting to show that this is sufficient to imply the corresponding retraction theorem: \"Consider the inclusion map of the two-point set as boundary of the interval . There is no continuous map which is a retraction for j.\"  Since is a two-point set, perhaps we can use the fact that there are only four possible endomaps that can exist in that space. These are illustrated below:   Possible endomaps on two point space      Of these four maps, precisely one has the property of \"having no fixed point\". This antipodal map sends each of the points in to the \"opposite\" point. For the sake of convenience, let's can name these points . The antipodal map is equivalent to the operation , with the other maps being given by , , . This is the unique endomap on satisfying .  I'm thinking the easiest way to approach this is to assume we have some map that acts like our \"antipodal\" map sending each point to it's mirror on the other half of the interval. For us to have any notion of continuity on this interval, we'd need to be able to take an arbitrarily small step to one side of each endpoint so we should be able to take the opposite step from the other. In other words, for any , we can pair with . Using the interval and as this operation, it's easy to see that produces a fixed point in the middle at where it's equidistantant from the endpoints .  If any map on this interval was going to \"have no fixed point\", it would have needed to be an antipodal map. In order for any map to possibly satisfy , it needs to divide the points into two sections. Our map either needs to map \"0.5\" to itself or to leave it undefined altogther. If we have arrows going from 0 to 1 and arrows from 1 to 0, at some point along the way the \"heads\" of our arrows need to go past the \"tails\" coming from the opposite direction.  Perhaps this makes more sense if I step back a bit and state something \"obvious\": There is no retraction from to .  has two points while has one.  might have a section, in which case we have one of the two bottom diagrams in the possible endomaps figure above. This would be our map that takes the fixed point and sends it to itself. We can go from , but we make by going from because there simply aren't enough points to work with.  It sounds like a variation of the intermediate value theorem. If there's a path of arrows leading from 0 to 1, then we should be able to reverse it and follow the arrows from 1 to 0. When we do, either there needs to be some fixed point that connects the heads from one path to the tails from the other or we don't have a continuous path we jump!  In summary:    The only endomap on with no fixed point is the antipodal map.    The only endomap on that could potentially not have a fixed point would be the antipodal map.    The antipodal map on has a fixed point.    There is no endomap on without fixed point.    Any retract preserves fixed points.    There is no retract from to     If it sounds like I'm unsure at this point, that's because I am. Maybe attempting the second theorem will provide more insight.  For (2) we're given that any continuous endomap on the closed disk, must have a fixed point. We want to prove that there is no continuous map which is a retraction for the inclusion map of the circle into the disk.  I think we can develop a similar definition of an \"antipodal map\" on the circle by reflecting across the center of the disk. This map is a unique endomap on . It has no fixed points for the circle   and acts as it's own inverse  . We can extend this map to the disk, but it fails to provide an inverse for the point at the center which we reflected over. Our antipodal map is the only possible section of the disk's boundary, but it fails to be a retraction due to this \"missing\" point in the middle.  A similar line of reasoning should hold true for the sphere. The antipodal map reflects each point on the sphere across the center to the opposite side. It's the only possible section that doesn't fix any points on the sphere, but then any corresponding retraction on the ball would be missing the center or have a fixed point there.  After all that, I'm still a little uncertain about this. I'm not convinced my proof is correct, but I also won't find out one way or the other unless I keep moving. So, on we go.     Exercise 4:   Express the restrictions given above on my travel and yours...    Story time! I'm chilling in Buffalo on a Friday morning when I get a call from a friend and decide to take a road trip to Rochester to vist them. So at noon, I jump in the car and start heading there, but I remember I left my wallet! I bust a U and go back home to look for it. By the time I find it, my tummy is growling. I head over my favorite taqueria for a bite. It's a little out of my way, but the salsa is to die for. I finally get on the road again, but now everyone is getting out of work so I hit some nasty traffic on the way. After crawling along a snail's pace for a few hours I'm starting to get tired and need to use the restroom. I make a quick detour to a little cafe I just passed. By the time I'm back on the road again, traffic has cleared up and it's a straight shot to Rochester at 5:00pm. My trip might look something like this:   Sample map corresponding to \"my\" story      Okay, maybe I got carried away, but this is \"my\" story. It has a beginning, in Buffalo at noon and it has an end, in Rochester at 5:00pm. In the figure above, the horizontal axis is the time in hours since my departure, and the vertical axis in the distance in miles along the road. Note that in my story, I double back for tacos, which is why there's a section in the map with negative distance. \"Your\" story might be a little different, but what I do know is that you were \"somewhere on the road between Buffalo and Rochester\" for the entire duration. For now, let's suppose you just drive back a forth along some stretch of road in the middle like so:   Sample map corresponding to \"your\" story      It should be obvious in this case that our paths have to cross, but we're trying to generalize these maps as much as possible. For now, let's start giving some of these objects proper names.  Let be our start time and end time for \"endpoints\" of the trip in \"time\". Let be Buffalo and Rochester, our \"endpoints\" on the \"road\". Since both time and space are continuous, these endpoints can be included in the respective intervals and . Let's call the inclusion map on the \"time\"-line to be and the inclusion map on the \"position\"-line to be . Note that Brouwer's 1st Theorem says there can't exist any retractions for either of these maps.  My position at any given time is a map that needs to satisfy certain conditions. I know and : that at the start of my trip I'm in Buffalo and at the end I'm in Rochester. Note that since our endpoints are included: .  The premise of this thought experiment is based around the idea that if \"you\" also have a map we must necessarily meet somewhere in that \"space-time\". We're using some kind of \"freeway distance\", where my 'location' sticks to the exit I took off it when I needed to make a stop.  Maybe \"you\" lived your entire life in Buffalo such that your , our meeting place would be at the start of of my trip or some time prior! In the other extreme, maybe you've lived your entire life in Rochester and your . In this case, \"you meeting me\" is contigent on \"me deciding to make the trip\" and we \"meet\" at 5:00pm. It's also possible you've never been to either Buffalo nor Rochester but live some place along the way, or maybe have been to one but not the other. In any of these cases, we can can map your position to some sub-interval of for the entire time period .  What I'm going to argue is that if you have such a map and we never meet we can construct a continuous retraction from with no fixed point. Since Brouwer's theorem establishes that such a retraction can't exist, there must be some with the property .  First, let's rule out the \"easy maps\". Suppose I hadn't doubled back at all and moved steadily from Buffalo to Rochester so that my path is invertable I have a unique position for every time. We'd be able to use your map construct endomap on through the composition given by . Our fixed point theorem says any continuous endomap has a fixed point, so there's some with . Apply on the left side to get . We meet at time and position .  What if your map is invertable? Well, then we could use it to construct an endomap on . We compose . This implies there's some fixed point with . Note that our spaces are different, so here we meet at time and position .  There is however, one map that might have the property . Imagine my \"evil twin\". This twin starts in the opposite city and takes the opposite that I do along the way. If map is going to avoid coming into contact with me at every step in my journey, it would have to be him. He takes every step I do, but in the opposite direction! This is the composition of my map with the \"antipodal map\" on it takes every moment in my journey in reverse. If my map is continuous, so is my evil twin. If there's a sequence of arrows, we can reverse them.  We've already established that my journey is not invertable, so it stands to reason that my evil twin would also have that property. But check this out, even me and my evil twin need to meet!   My \"evil twin\" map    The composition of the antipodal map on followed my must be the same as followed by the antipodal map on . My trip needs to be reversable, but we've already shown that it can't be. The fixed point theorem says me and my evil twin have to either meet or jump over each other the map can't be continuous without the meet-up!  I'm thinking that we can use the meeting place of myself and my evil twin as an approximation for the midpoint of my journey. Your map needs to have some evil twin midpoint also. If we alternate \"halfway points\", we should be able to do something of a binary search to home in on each other's location in terms of whether we're closer in the front or back half of our respective trips. Essentially, we'd have an analogue for the mean value theorem .  I think this is about as close as I'm going to get for \"an answer\" to (a) and (b) for the week. I'm not really sure how I would generalize it further for (c) and (d). I feel like right now there's a glaring weak spot in my argument by even assuming is well-defined for the entire space. What if \"you\" were born or died sometime during my trip? Would I still necessarily \"meet\" you?  The thing that I'm left curious is about the connection between Brouwer's theorems and my notions about simplices. I'm used to this idea of going from a point , to a line segment , to a triangle , to a tetrahedra , and then generalizing to higher dimensional spaces from there. There seems like an obvious parallel to Brouwer's first theorem that says we can't have a retraction from to , or from any to with for that matter.    Having \"attempted\" all of the exercises in the session, I think I'll stop here. I feel like I could easily spend another week on this session, but since the authors explicitly state it's not important I'll take them for their word. They obviously have spent a lot more time on it than I have. I didn't even have time to proofread myself this week!  "

Note that in my story, I double back for tacos, which is why there's a section in the map with negative distance. \"Your\" story might be a little different, but what I do know is that you were \"somewhere on the road between Buffalo and Rochester\" for the entire duration. For now, let's suppose you just drive back a forth along some stretch of road in the middle like so:   Sample map corresponding to \"your\" story      It should be obvious in this case that our paths have to cross, but we're trying to generalize these maps as much as possible. For now, let's start giving some of these objects proper names.  Let be our start time and end time for \"endpoints\" of the trip in \"time\". Let be Buffalo and Rochester, our \"endpoints\" on the \"road\". Since both time and space are continuous, these endpoints can be included in the respective intervals and . Let's call the inclusion map on the \"time\"-line to be and the inclusion map on the \"position\"-line to be . Note that Brouwer's 1st Theorem says there can't exist any retractions for either of these maps.  My position at any given time is a map that needs to satisfy certain conditions. I know and : that at the start of my trip I'm in Buffalo and at the end I'm in Rochester. Note that since our endpoints are included: .  The premise of this thought experiment is based around the idea that if \"you\" also have a map we must necessarily meet somewhere in that \"space-time\". We're using some kind of \"freeway distance\", where my 'location' sticks to the exit I took off it when I needed to make a stop.  Maybe \"you\" lived your entire life in Buffalo such that your , our meeting place would be at the start of of my trip or some time prior! In the other extreme, maybe you've lived your entire life in Rochester and your . In this case, \"you meeting me\" is contigent on \"me deciding to make the trip\" and we \"meet\" at 5:00pm. It's also possible you've never been to either Buffalo nor Rochester but live some place along the way, or maybe have been to one but not the other. In any of these cases, we can can map your position to some sub-interval of for the entire time period .  What I'm going to argue is that if you have such a map and we never meet we can construct a continuous retraction from with no fixed point. Since Brouwer's theorem establishes that such a retraction can't exist, there must be some with the property .  First, let's rule out the \"easy maps\". Suppose I hadn't doubled back at all and moved steadily from Buffalo to Rochester so that my path is invertable I have a unique position for every time. We'd be able to use your map construct endomap on through the composition given by . Our fixed point theorem says any continuous endomap has a fixed point, so there's some with . Apply on the left side to get . We meet at time and position .  What if your map is invertable? Well, then we could use it to construct an endomap on . We compose . This implies there's some fixed point with . Note that our spaces are different, so here we meet at time and position .  There is however, one map that might have the property . Imagine my \"evil twin\". This twin starts in the opposite city and takes the opposite that I do along the way. If map is going to avoid coming into contact with me at every step in my journey, it would have to be him. He takes every step I do, but in the opposite direction! This is the composition of my map with the \"antipodal map\" on it takes every moment in my journey in reverse. If my map is continuous, so is my evil twin. If there's a sequence of arrows, we can reverse them.  We've already established that my journey is not invertable, so it stands to reason that my evil twin would also have that property. But check this out, even me and my evil twin need to meet!   My \"evil twin\" map    The composition of the antipodal map on followed my must be the same as followed by the antipodal map on . My trip needs to be reversable, but we've already shown that it can't be. The fixed point theorem says me and my evil twin have to either meet or jump over each other the map can't be continuous without the meet-up!  I'm thinking that we can use the meeting place of myself and my evil twin as an approximation for the midpoint of my journey. Your map needs to have some evil twin midpoint also. If we alternate \"halfway points\", we should be able to do something of a binary search to home in on each other's location in terms of whether we're closer in the front or back half of our respective trips. Essentially, we'd have an analogue for the mean value theorem .  I think this is about as close as I'm going to get for \"an answer\" to (a) and (b) for the week. I'm not really sure how I would generalize it further for (c) and (d). I feel like right now there's a glaring weak spot in my argument by even assuming is well-defined for the entire space. What if \"you\" were born or died sometime during my trip? Would I still necessarily \"meet\" you?  The thing that I'm left curious is about the connection between Brouwer's theorems and my notions about simplices. I'm used to this idea of going from a point , to a line segment , to a triangle , to a tetrahedra , and then generalizing to higher dimensional spaces from there. There seems like an obvious parallel to Brouwer's first theorem that says we can't have a retraction from to , or from any to with for that matter.   "

  "body": " Article 3: Examples of Categories, Part 1  I think this is about where I started getting lost the first time through this text, but I feel like I'm coming into it with a better foundation this time around. There's also 30 exercises over the course of Article 3, so I already anticipate a need to break it up into parts. I want to make sure I take my time here and really understand what's going on.   Exercise 1:   Show that if both as above and also...    Our basic idea here is that \"respects the structure\" of our category . That is:   Satisifies for all endomaps and .  Now suppose we have another map with    We can then compose these maps to produce a composition :   This map should preserve structure also if we can prove that . This should be fairly straight forward to show using the associative property and our previous assumptions:      And that completes the exercise.     Exercise 2:   What can you prove...    Recall that an endomap is \"idempotent\" if . If is a \"retraction\" for , that implies .  Watch what happens when if we apply on the right of both sides to :     Essentially, a retraction preserves the fixed point proprerty. Since fixes every point it touches and this retraction can restore each value afterwards, that can only happen if .     Exercise 3:   A finite set has an even number of elements iff...    I'm not really sure what the question is, so I'm assuming this is a \"prove it\" problem. I think this is essentially the approach I tried to take with Brouwer's theorems lasts.  If we define as set being \"even\" iff there is an involution with no fixed points. This is like the \"antipodal map\" I explored earlier that pairs up each point in a space with it's \"opposite\". When we're working with an antipodal map on the interval, we either we have a point in the middle that maps to itself or we \"jump\" over it. The fixed point property becomes a proxy for whether or not the map is continuous because we forced the interval to be \"odd\". The only problem with using this idea here is that the interval had a natural order to it while the set may not, so our involution isn't necessarily unique.  Maybe it might help to think of taking a map applying and taking an \"image\" of it for every . Either we find some point or we don't, but we can use this to classify each point as \"fixed\" or \"not\". Essentially this process defines map that returns if a point is fixed by or if it doesn't. However, since is known to be an involution with then there needs to be at least as many points in as there are in which ensures that .  Framing the problem like this allows us to ask if there exists a section of which permits a retraction on . More specifically, we're looking for a map with . If then , and consequently would be undefined. If has no fixed points then , and consequently would be undefined. In order for this map to exist, must have at least one fixed point and one non-fixed point. That is, for some we have and some such that with and .  The problem with this is that such a map can't exist without having at least three points: , , . It's impossible for a composition of the any form to ever produce an identity map. If a retraction for existed it would need to be the same as the section, so clearly the fixed point property on means that no map is a retraction from to .  I feel like I'm starting to talk in circles now, so I'll just add that I think there's some parallels to be made with the \"split idempotent\" exercise from Session 9.  If all points in are fixed, that implies a splitting of by . If no points in are fixed, that also implies a splitting of by . If has both fixed and non-fixed points, that implies a splitting of by . Since there is no isomorphism between and , we use the result of Session 9 Exercise 3 to infer that can't be split by both of them simultaneously. If our has both fixed and non-fixed points, the set of fixed points would preserve an isomorphism with  meaning that the point fixed by would necessarily be unique. Likewise, each non-fixed point needs to exists as part of a pair with some to preserve the isomorphism between and .  I'm not sure if I'm using this concept of \"splitting by \" correctly here, but it seems like it might be a reasonable analogy of \"division by two\" for generic maps.     Exercise 4:   If is considered as an endomap of ...    This would be characterized as an \"involution\" since implies . It has a fixed point at since . It's not idempotent since for any .

It mights the criteria for a \"section\" since , but it's not a \"retraction\" since for any which is not a multiple of 5. This map is neither idempotent nor an involution, but does have fixed point at 0.     Exercise 9:   In , consider the endomap ...

Finally, we need to check whether or not is an involution. Since an involution would imply , the case of serves as a counter-example to this expression.    Seeing that we move on to a new category after this exercise, I think this might be a good place to stop for the week. With the extra time, I managed to write a blog post about joining the Fediverse . Maybe my stream of cat pics will encourage others to have fun with cat theory.  "
