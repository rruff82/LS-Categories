    <title>What is this?</title>
    <p>I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein "L&amp;S") on my own and it's been kind of difficult.  
      Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an
      effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.
    </p>
    <p>With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with <pretext />.  
      I've done a lot of work using <latex/> for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering 
      diagrams with the TiKz package.  
    </p>
    <p>To start, I went through my old notes on L&amp;S from my first attempted reading. It looks like I made to to around session 11 before I started really getting lost. 
      Furthermore, the erasable ink I had used to solve the exercises originally had faded significantly since I originally worked on
      this.   
      Since I'm expecting one of my major difficulties with this to be recreating the diagrams, I figured restarting from the very beginning would
      be the best way forward.
    </p>
    <p>I know myself better than to make promises about the rate I get through this, but part of me thinks it would be fun to do "cat theory on caturday". 
     Giving myself a day of the week to finish by might give me the push I need to get it done.  Besides, everything is better with cats.
