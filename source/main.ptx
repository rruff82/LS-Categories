      <section xml:id="about">
        <title>What is this?</title>
        <p>I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein "L&amp;S") on my own and it's been kind of difficult.  
          Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an
          effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with <pretext />.  
          I've done a lot of work using <latex/> for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering 
          diagrams with the TiKz package.  
        </p>
        <p>To start, I went through my old notes on L&amp;S from my first attempted reading. It looks like I made to to around session 11 before I started really getting lost. 
          Furthermore, the erasable ink I had used to solve the exercises originally had faded significantly since I originally worked on
          this.   
          Since I'm expecting one of my major difficulties with this to be recreating the diagrams, I figured restarting from the very beginning would
          be the best way forward.
        </p>
        <p>I know myself better than to make promises about the rate I get through this, but part of me thinks it would be fun to do "cat theory on caturday". 
         Giving myself a day of the week to finish by might give me the push I need to get it done.  Besides, everything is better with cats.  
        </p>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="session1">
        <title>Session 1</title>
        <p>
          Since L&amp;S start Session 1 prior to "Part 1", I figured I should do the same.  I'm presuming the reader has access to
          the source material and hope that my abbreviated reproduction of the prompts this way is "fair use".  After all, calling them "exercises"
          implies they're meant for me to work out, no?
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...other examples of combining two objects to get a third..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps
              <m>BEHAVIOR=NATURE \times NURTURE</m> might satisfy the pattern here.  The way my cats seem to behave is
              based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment 
              where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, 
              however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the "maps".  
            </p>
            <p>
              The diagrams in session 1 had the following structure:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-cd">
              <caption>A typical diagram of the examples considered in L&amp;S "Session 1"</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-cd">
            
            <latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\node (A) at (0,1) {$A$};
\node (B) at (1,1) {$B$};
\node (C) at (0,0) {$C$};
\path[->,font=\scriptsize,>=angle 90]
(A) edge node[above]{$\phi$} (B)
(A) edge node[right]{$\theta$} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
              </image>
            
            </figure>
            <p>
            It didn't really make sense to me to think of "behavior" as A in this diagram and nature/nuture as B/C because 
            I could think of many situations where a single behavior might make sense in different environments. It seems 
            more natural to think of behavior as function of environment rather than the environment as a function of the
            behavior. I feel like the qualities I identified might more accurately be arranged like so:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-alt">
              <caption>Alternate explanation structure of behavior (A), nature (B), and nurture (C)</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-alt">
            
            <latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\node (A) at (1,0) {$A$};
\node (B) at (1,1) {$B$};

              </image>
            
            </figure>
            
            <p>
              I think some of this unease comes from the complexity associated with behavior.  I think on some level I'm confusing 
              a "behavioral genotype" with a "behavioral phenotype".  Being a cat creates a behavior profile of the actions they
              might engage in, but the environment selects for which actions are allowed to manifest. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's define <m>A</m> as "the set of animals".  We can consider "instincts" as a map <m>\phi</m> that maps each animal to its
              "natural behavior profile" in set B.  We can also consider "selection" as a map <m>\theta</m> that maps each animal to an 
              "environmental reward profile" in set C.  Under these definitions, it seems reasonable to think of the composite 
              map <m>\phi \circ \theta</m> (or <m>\theta \circ \phi</m>) producing an "observed behavior profile" in set D. 
            </p>

              <caption>Full diagram of behavior expression as maps.</caption>

            <latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]

            </figure>

            <p>
              As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats "playing with toys".  Given that they are cats, 
              I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result.  However, I also restrict their environment
              so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey.  What we percieve as "playing" is really a proxy for murderous
              insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.  
            </p>

            <p>
              I think I can see how this additional structure helped to clarify what had started as an vague idea.  It makes a lot
              more sense to think of mapping from a specific cat to a behavior profile, than trying to map from a cat's behavior 
              profile to a specific environment.
            </p>

          </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
          <title>Exercise 2:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...describe an experiment for deciding whether two nearby points are at the same level..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I feel there's an obvious answer to this question: a level. By using a bit of water in a clear container, you could 
              convievably build a rudamentary level by comparing the slant of the water against a marked line.  The only tricky part
              is designing it so you could align it with the points you want to compare, but the basic idea is that if the points are
              level then the water wouldn't tilt. The authors' use of the word "level" in the prompt makes me think they were heavily
              leading the reader towards something like this.  A level makes it easy to hang pictures expressly because it removes the 
              need to measure up from the floor.

          This is technically my second time through this content and 
I think I made some errors in my original solutions to exercises
2-5.  Rather than ignore my mistakes, I've made the decision to
recreate them here and explain why I think I was wrong afterward. 
I hope this method will give more insight into my thought process. 
To prevent accidental spoilers, this will be treated as a 
"Hidden Exercise 10".
