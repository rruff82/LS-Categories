      <section xml:id="about">
        <title>What is this?</title>
        <p>I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein "L&amp;S") on my own and it's been kind of difficult.  
          Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an
          effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with <pretext />.  
          I've done a lot of work using <latex/> for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering 
          diagrams with the TiKz package.  
        </p>
        <p>To start, I went through my old notes on L&amp;S from my first attempted reading. It looks like I made to to around session 11 before I started really getting lost. 
          Furthermore, the erasable ink I had used to solve the exercises originally had faded significantly since I originally worked on
          this.   
          Since I'm expecting one of my major difficulties with this to be recreating the diagrams, I figured restarting from the very beginning would
          be the best way forward.
        </p>
        <p>I know myself better than to make promises about the rate I get through this, but part of me thinks it would be fun to do "cat theory on caturday". 
         Giving myself a day of the week to finish by might give me the push I need to get it done.  Besides, everything is better with cats.  
        </p>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="session1">
        <title>Session 1</title>
        <p>
          Since L&amp;S start Session 1 prior to "Part 1", I figured I should do the same.  I'm presuming the reader has access to
          the source material and hope that my abbreviated reproduction of the prompts this way is "fair use".  After all, calling them "exercises"
          implies they're meant for me to work out, no?
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...other examples of combining two objects to get a third..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps
              <m>BEHAVIOR=NATURE \times NURTURE</m> might satisfy the pattern here.  The way my cats seem to behave is
              based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment 
              where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, 
              however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the "maps".  
            </p>
            <p>
              The diagrams in session 1 had the following structure:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-cd">
              <caption>A typical diagram of the examples considered in L&amp;S "Session 1"</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-cd">
            
            <latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\node (A) at (0,1) {$A$};
\node (B) at (1,1) {$B$};
\node (C) at (0,0) {$C$};
\path[->,font=\scriptsize,>=angle 90]
(A) edge node[above]{$\phi$} (B)
(A) edge node[right]{$\theta$} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
              </image>
            
            </figure>
            <p>
            It didn't really make sense to me to think of "behavior" as A in this diagram and nature/nuture as B/C because 
            I could think of many situations where a single behavior might make sense in different environments. It seems 
            more natural to think of behavior as function of environment rather than the environment as a function of the
            behavior. I feel like the qualities I identified might more accurately be arranged like so:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-alt">
              <caption>Alternate explanation structure of behavior (A), nature (B), and nurture (C)</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-alt">
            
            <latex-image>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
              I think some of this unease comes from the complexity associated with behavior.  I think on some level I'm confusing 
              a "behavioral genotype" with a "behavioral phenotype".  Being a cat creates a behavior profile of the actions they
              might engage in, but the environment selects for which actions are allowed to manifest. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's define <m>A</m> as "the set of animals".  We can consider "instincts" as a map <m>\phi</m> that maps each animal to its
              "natural behavior profile" in set B.  We can also consider "selection" as a map <m>\theta</m> that maps each animal to an 
              "environmental reward profile" in set C.  Under these definitions, it seems reasonable to think of the composite 
              map <m>\phi \circ \theta</m> (or <m>\theta \circ \phi</m>) producing an "observed behavior profile" in set D. 
            </p>

            <p>
              As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats "playing with toys".  Given that they are cats, 
              I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result.  However, I also restrict their environment
              so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey.  What we percieve as "playing" is really a proxy for murderous
              insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.  
            </p>

            <p>
              I think I can see how this additional structure helped to clarify what had started as an vague idea.  It makes a lot
              more sense to think of mapping from a specific cat to a behavior profile, than trying to map from a cat's behavior 
              profile to a specific environment.
            </p>

          </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
          <title>Exercise 2:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...describe an experiment for deciding whether two nearby points are at the same level..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I feel there's an obvious answer to this question: a level. By using a bit of water in a clear container, you could 
              convievably build a rudamentary level by comparing the slant of the water against a marked line.  The only tricky part
              is designing it so you could align it with the points you want to compare, but the basic idea is that if the points are
              level then the water wouldn't tilt. The authors' use of the word "level" in the prompt makes me think they were heavily
              leading the reader towards something like this.  A level makes it easy to hang pictures expressly because it removes the 
              need to measure up from the floor.

          This is technically my second time through this content and 
I think I made some errors in my original solutions to exercises
2-5.  Rather than ignore my mistakes, I've made the decision to
recreate them here and explain why I think I was wrong afterward. 
I hope this method will give more insight into my thought process. 
To prevent accidental spoilers, this will be treated as a 
"Hidden Exercise 10".

              How many different maps <m>f</m> are there with domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>B</m>?...    
            </p>
          </statement>

            <p>
              So I approached this like I would an algebraic function like 
<m>f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x+2}</m>, but instead of feeding in a number
I'm feeding in John (<m>J</m>), Mary (<m>M</m>) or Sam (<m>S</m>) 
and getting out a breakfast order at a diner that only serves 
eggs (<m>e</m>) or coffee (<m>c</m>) and has a 1 item limit per order.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that the number of outcomes is going to be the same
for each person, so it made sense to focus on one person at
a time.  I imagined John's breakfast order, <m>f(J)</m>, as
having 3 possible outcomes.
            </p>

              Likewise, Mary and Sam have the same 3 possible outcomes: {eggs,coffee,undefined}.
Since these events are independent of each other, the total number of possible

              I thought of this function like the "favorite person" map example from the
reading.  Using John as an example, I imagined 4 possible character roles 
in a hypothetical Hollywood love triangle:
            </p>
<ol>
	<li>John is in love with Mary. <m>f(J)=M</m></li>
	<li>John is in love with Sam.  <m>f(J)=S</m></li>
	<li>John is a narcissist, in love with himself: <m>f(J)=J</m></li>
	<li>John is a psychopath, incapable of love: <m>f(J)</m> is undefined</li>
</ol>
          <p>
            Given an analogous set of 4 outcomes for Mary and Sam, the total number of 
possible plot outcomes is <m>4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64</m>.

            I imagined this one as a "mystery breakfast order".  I'm the a waiter in

John, Mary, and Sam are seated.  The map <m>f</m> tells me who ordered a given
dish.  Like before, I'll consider one example at a time.  There are 4 possible
outcomes for the source of the eggs:  
            </p>
            <ol>
	<li>John ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=J</m></li>
	<li>Mary ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=M</m></li>
	<li>Sam ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=S</m></li>
	<li>Nobody ordered eggs: <m>f(e)</m> is undefined</li>
</ol>	
          <p>
            Since there must likewise be 4 sources for the coffee, the total number of

              At this point I had observed a pattern and attempted to generalize. Following
my reasoning from exercises 2-4, I notice all my answers fit a pattern: 
            </p>
            <me>
(\text{number of maps}) = (1+(\text{size of codomain}))^\text{size of domain}
            </me>
            <p>
              In exercise 5, the size of the domain and codmain would each be 2.  Evaluating
the expression above gives us <m>(1+2)^2=9</m> possible maps.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 6</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
             How many maps <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} A</m> satisfy <m>f \circ f = f</m>?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              This is where I started to notice some problems with my previous reasoning.
In order for me to talk about the properties of <m>f \circ f</m>, it didn't
make sense for <m>f</m> to be "undefined" for an element in my domain.  If
I didn't get something "out", I wouldn't be able to feed it back in.  So
instead of considering all <m>4^3=64</m> possible "love triangles" I identified earlier,
I could narrow my search down to a more limited set of <m>3^3=27</m> maps by 
excluding the "psychopaths" from my romance movies because they make it 
impossible to produce a sequel (more on that idea later).  
            </p>
            <p>
              This narrowed my search, but 27 is still too many for me too sort out by hand so
I started looking for ways to break it down further. I knew I could satisfy the
<m>f \circ f = f</m> constraint with the identity map because clearly
<m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>.  I also know I could satisfy 
<m>f \circ f = f</m> with a "constant function" such as the following: 
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, there would need to be a total of 3 such "constant functions" 
because you'd need one for each of the 3 possible destinations.  At that point
it seemed clear I was still missing some. If I could construct a function 
<m>f</m> with 1 arrow to each point and also a function <m>f</m> with 3 arrows
to a single point, it seemed reasonable to assume there'd be a class of maps
with 2 arrows leading to a single point.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's consider the case where that point with two arrows leading in to 
be "John".  One of the arrows leading to John has to be from himself for
<m>f \circ f (J) = f(J)</m> to be true, but the other arrow could originate at
either Mary or Sam.  Given these two possible maps exist for each person, we'd have
<m>3 \cdot 2 = 6</m> maps of this type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putting everything together, some patterns seem to emerge when I listed these 
out in a table using binomials. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Adding up all of these up gives us total of <m>3+6+1=10</m> possible maps.

            <p>
              This was made even easier by the pattern I noticed in the previous example.
Given that there are only two elements in the domain, there are 
<m>\binom{2}{1}=2</m> maps with 1 fixed point and <m>\binom{2}{2}=1</m> map
with 2 fixed points (namely, <m>1_A</m>) for total of <m>2+1=3</m>.

              None? B has fewer choices in it than A, so when f maps from A to B it must 
destroy at least one of them.  The map g would not be able to produce 3 outputs
from only 2 inputs, so there's no possible way for the composition to cover
all elements of A.

              What first clued me in that my answers to exercises 2-5 might be wrong was 
the hint about "BOOKKEEPING rules" at the very end of the section. Looking
back, it's seem like my programming background may have clouded my 
understanding of "map".  
            </p>
            <p>
              I was thinking about a "map" like I would a "function" in a program.  In this
analogy I had interpreted "domain" as my "input type" and "codomain" as 
"output type".  The flaw in this reasoning is that I was allowing "functions"
to "error", which is not true under the definitions of "map" and "domain" that
were presented.  If the map <m>f(J)</m> produced something "undefined", it 
would be inaccurate to include <m>J</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
          This means that the generalized formula I came up with earlier is "off by 1", 
and the corrected formula should be as follows:    
            </p>
                        <me>
(\text{number of maps}) = (\text{size of codomain})^\text{size of domain}
            </me>
            <p>
              Under these revised definitions, the answers to excercises 2-5 should be as follows:
            </p>
            <table>

          <p>
            I can see why these definitions simplify the process of talking about
"bookkeeping" for the number maps. It's much easier to count the maps 
if we limit ourselves to the ones that are well-formed to start with.  
I'm left wondering if there's a situation where having an "undefined"
output token like I used might be a useful construct, but the costs seem 
to far outweigh the benefits. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I can also see some programming parallels here between the "switch" statement
in C-like languages and the "match" statement in Rust.  The Rust compiler
goes an extra step to verify that every possible outcome has been handled
before even attempting to complile the code you give it.  This provides an
extra level of assurance that these functions will behave as expected.

  in such a way that <m>0^0=1</m>. This is a common practice, but I've also seen
  situations where <m>0^0</m> is left undefined instead.  In this context, the answer
  of 1 to problem 5 makes more sense than than the alternative.  In programming terms,
  it seems perfectly reasonable to think of "no op" as a "function" so there should be
  an analogous "null map" that maps from nothing to nothing.

          This week's reading basically confirmed my generalization from Article 1.  I found it somewhat interesting
          how I instictively happened to use a "vector norm" notation, <m>||A||</m>, for the size of domain and codomain 
          while L&amp;S goes through both "number sign", <m>\#A</m>, and "absolute value", <m>|A|</m>.  It seems so natural
          to want a symbol for "number of elements".  
        </p>

          For present, I suppose I'll follow the book's convention and save myself two extra characters.  It does leave
          me wondering what kind of distance metrics might be useful for talking about the "sameness" of two maps. 
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1</title>
          <statement>

              ...Two of the expressions make sense...

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              So the trick with the map composition is to evaluate them from "right to left".  The expression for (a) 
              of <m>k \circ h \circ g \circ f</m> could be translated into a sequence of steps as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
               Notice how the codomain of each step matches the domain of the following step. Our composite map
               follows a path from 
               <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m>, so it's domain is the "source" <m>A</m>
               and codomain is the "destination" <m>B</m>.  Alternatively written, <m>A \xrightarrow{k \circ h \circ g \circ f} B</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving on to (b), something interesting happens when we attempt to list out the steps of <m>k \circ f \circ g</m>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Apply map <m>B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Notice how the codomain for step 2 of <m>B</m> is not the same as the domain of <m>C</m> in step 3.  This map composition
              is not well defined because the map <m>k</m> will not have a valid input to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having already identified the one that "doesn't make sense", let's move directly onto identifying the domain and codomain 
              of the final composition (c) <m>g \circ f \circ g \circ k \circ h</m>.  Applied from right to left, this gives us:
            </p>
            <me>
              A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A
            </me>
            <p>
              As expected, the domains and codomains link up correctly at each step.  This means that the domain of <m>g \circ f \circ g \circ k \circ h</m> is <m>A</m> (same as the domain of the first map applied, <m>h</m>)
              and the codomain is <m>A</m> (same as the codomain of the last map applied, <m>g</m>).

        <p>
          Time to undo things!  I think I'm coming into this section with a decent grasp of what an
          isomorphism is already, but this idea that there are two inverses instead of just one still
          feels a little weird to me.  I find myself reminding myself that this something I already do, 
          but now I'm just being more specific with my language.  
        </p>
        <p>
          If teaching has taught me anything, it's that people sometimes have very different ideas about
          what is meant by seemingly simple phrases like "the opposite of two".  It's often too easy to fall 
          into a trap in assuming that since I'm thinking of two as a position on the number line and the 
          opposite of that is defined relative to the origin, but "negative two" is really only one possible
          answer.  If the question "what's the oppositve of two?" had beem asked in the kitchen instead of
          a math class, there's a case to be made that "one half" is actually the more appropriate response.
          The opposite of doubling a recipe is halving one.  There might even be situations where it may
          be helpful to think of "opposite" as both the reciprocal and negation, as you would with slopes
          of perpendicular lines. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I think I need to be paying attention to the domains and codomains of the maps because
          that's where I was getting tripped up earlier.

            <p>
              For the reflexive property (R), we can note that <m>A \xrightarrow{1_A} A</m> acts as it's own
              inverse.  Since it leaves every object in place, applying it a second time would also do nothing 
              so <m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>.  If we define <m>f = 1_A</m> and <m>g = 1_A</m>, then the statements
              <m>f \circ g = 1_A</m> and <m>g \circ f = 1_A</m> hold true and <m>1_A</m> is an isomorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the symmetric property (S), we're given that <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m> is an isomorphism with 
              inverse <m>B \xrightarrow{g} A</m>.  By the definition of inverse, we know <m>g \circ f = 1_A</m> and 
              <m>f \circ g = 1_B</m>.  These are precisely the two statements that define <m>B \xrightarrow{g} A</m>
              as the inverse of <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m>, just with the order reversed.  By including both possible
              composition orders in the definition, it guarantees that <m>f</m> is the inverse of <m>g</m> if and only if
              <m>g</m> is the inverse of <m>f</m>.

              For the transitive property, we're given that <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m> and <m>B \xrightarrow{k} C</m>
              are both isomorphisms.  Let <m>B \xrightarrow{f^{-1}} A</m> be the inverse of <m>f</m> such that 
              <m>f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>, and let <m>C \xrightarrow{k^{-1}} B</m> be the inverse of <m>k</m> such that 
              <m>k^{-1} \circ k = 1_B</m> and <m>k \circ k^{-1} = 1_C</m>.  Consider the composition <m>C \xrightarrow{f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}} A</m>:

              <li>
                Consider <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f)</m>.  By the associative property, we have
                <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f) = f^{-1} \circ (k^{-1} \circ k) \circ f</m>. Since <m>k^{-1} \circ k=1_B</m>, it follows that <m>f^{-1} \circ (k^{-1} \circ k) \circ f = f^{-1} \circ 1_B \circ f = f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m>.

              <li>
                Consider <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1})</m>.  By the associative property, we have
                <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) = k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ k^{-1} </m>.  Since 
                <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>, it follows that <m>k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ k^{-1} = k \circ 1_B \circ k^{-1} = k \circ k^{-1} = 1_C</m>

                conclude that <m>A \xrightarrow{k \circ f} C</m> is an isomorphism with an inverse of <m>C \xrightarrow{f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}} A</m>.

            <p>
              Consider the point: <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)</m>. Since <m>k \circ f = 1_A</m>, we must have 
              <m>(k \circ f)(x_1) = 1_A(x_1) = x_1</m>.  However, since <m>x_1 = g(y)</m> we can also
              write this as <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=(k \circ f)(g(y))</m>.  By the associative property,
              <m>(k \circ f)(g(y))=k(f(g(y))) = k((f \circ g)(y)) = k(1_B(y)) = k(y) = x_2</m>.  Having
              shown that <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=x_1</m> and <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=x_2</m>, this contradicts
              our earlier assumption that <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m> and completes our proof that <m>g=k</m> by
              contradiction.

              Part (a) is given in the text, so lets focus on (b).  If <m>h \circ f = k \circ f</m>, it follows
              that <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = (k \circ f) \circ f^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the associative property, <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = h \circ (f \circ f^{-1})</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>.  Thus,
              <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = h \circ 1_B = h</m>.  By similar reasoning, <m>(k \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) = k \circ 1_B = k</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              It follows that <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = (k \circ f) \circ f^{-1}</m> if and only if <m>h = k</m> which completes our proof.

              Let's break it down one map at time.

              <li>
                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>f(x)=3x+7</m> has a well-defined inverse of <m>f^{-1}(x) = (x-7)/3</m>. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>g(x)=x^2</m> has a well-defined inverse of
                 <m>g^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{h} \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>h(x)=x^2</m> does <em>not</em> have a well-defined inverse.  We 
                can't ever recover the negative values after squaring them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{k} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>k(x)=x^2</m> also does <em>not</em> have a well-defined 
                inverse.  Limiting the codomain to the produced outputs doesn't change the fact that we're losing sign information through the map.
              </li>
              <li>
                <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>l(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}</m> feels like a trick.  For most
                intents and purposes, we <em>should</em> have <m>g^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{x}-1</m> but the domain and codomain don't look right here.  
                Specifically, we have a problem where <m>g^{-1}(0)</m> is undefined and another problem where <m>g^{-1} &lt; 0</m> 
                for <m>x &gt; 1</m>.  
                Based on these observations, I'd have to conclude that <m>k</m> is not invertable.

              Having still not entirely convinced myself these are correct, I thought it might be helpful to look at the graphs.

              One of the way's I think of my inverse function is as "a reflection over the line <m>x=y</m>".  This
              works nicely for a visual confirmation because I can tell that this relationship will hold for the 
              rest of the lines.  My confidence in <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}</m> being invertible is 
              very high.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let's take a look at the relation between <m>x^2</m> and <m>\sqrt{x}</m>:

              Notice how the inverse function only replicates half of the parabola when reflected over
              the diagonal. My justification for thinking that (2) is an isomorphism but (3) and (4) are 
              not is that every point in the domain needs to have an inverse that these can be 
              matched up with a point in the codomain (both "onto" and "one-to-one").  By including negative  
              numbers in our domain, we're essentially allowing un-invertable points to be passed in.
            </p>

              Now let's take a look at the final functions:

              On the surface, this looks like precisely the function we're looking for.  It looks
              like a pretty good "mirror image".  The problem comes when consider the domain and 
              codomain.  The map <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m>
              is only valid for positive values, so let's crop and zoom in our previous graph.

              Notice how the graph of <m>\frac{1}{x}-1</m> seemingly has an asymptote at <m>x=0</m>
              and gets "cut-off" when it hits the x-axis.  For us to consider this as an inverse map, 
              the domain of the inverse should match the codomain of the map and vice versa.  Even 
              though these maps meet my reflection criteria, the fact that <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l^{-1}} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> is 
              undefined for <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x &gt; 1</m> when domain and codomain are supposed to 
              both be <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> disqualifies it from being considered an inverse to 
              the map <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m>.

          While I'm in the process of undo-ing things, I need to work on undo-ing my tendancy to rush things like this.  I
          need to remind myself that learing this stuff isn't a race. I'm going to use the subdivisions in Article II to break 
          this up into smaller sections so I can give it more time to sink in.
