      <section xml:id="about">
        <title>What is this?</title>
        <p>I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein "L&amp;S") on my own and it's been kind of difficult.  
          Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an
          effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with <pretext />.  
          I've done a lot of work using <latex/> for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering 
          diagrams with the TiKz package.  
        </p>
        <p>To start, I went through my old notes on L&amp;S from my first attempted reading. It looks like I made to to around session 11 before I started really getting lost. 
          Furthermore, the erasable ink I had used to solve the exercises originally had faded significantly since I originally worked on
          this.   
          Since I'm expecting one of my major difficulties with this to be recreating the diagrams, I figured restarting from the very beginning would
          be the best way forward.
        </p>
        <p>I know myself better than to make promises about the rate I get through this, but part of me thinks it would be fun to do "cat theory on caturday". 
         Giving myself a day of the week to finish by might give me the push I need to get it done.  Besides, everything is better with cats.  
        </p>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="session1">
        <title>Session 1</title>
        <p>
          Since L&amp;S start Session 1 prior to "Part 1", I figured I should do the same.  I'm presuming the reader has access to
          the source material and hope that my abbreviated reproduction of the prompts this way is "fair use".  After all, calling them "exercises"
          implies they're meant for me to work out, no?
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...other examples of combining two objects to get a third..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps
              <m>BEHAVIOR=NATURE \times NURTURE</m> might satisfy the pattern here.  The way my cats seem to behave is
              based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment 
              where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, 
              however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the "maps".  
            </p>
            <p>
              The diagrams in session 1 had the following structure:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-cd">
              <caption>A typical diagram of the examples considered in L&amp;S "Session 1"</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-cd">
            
            <latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\node (A) at (0,1) {$A$};
\node (B) at (1,1) {$B$};
\node (C) at (0,0) {$C$};
\path[->,font=\scriptsize,>=angle 90]
(A) edge node[above]{$\phi$} (B)
(A) edge node[right]{$\theta$} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
              </image>
            
            </figure>
            <p>
            It didn't really make sense to me to think of "behavior" as A in this diagram and nature/nuture as B/C because 
            I could think of many situations where a single behavior might make sense in different environments. It seems 
            more natural to think of behavior as function of environment rather than the environment as a function of the
            behavior. I feel like the qualities I identified might more accurately be arranged like so:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-alt">
              <caption>Alternate explanation structure of behavior (A), nature (B), and nurture (C)</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-alt">
            
            <latex-image>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
              I think some of this unease comes from the complexity associated with behavior.  I think on some level I'm confusing 
              a "behavioral genotype" with a "behavioral phenotype".  Being a cat creates a behavior profile of the actions they
              might engage in, but the environment selects for which actions are allowed to manifest. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's define <m>A</m> as "the set of animals".  We can consider "instincts" as a map <m>\phi</m> that maps each animal to its
              "natural behavior profile" in set B.  We can also consider "selection" as a map <m>\theta</m> that maps each animal to an 
              "environmental reward profile" in set C.  Under these definitions, it seems reasonable to think of the composite 
              map <m>\phi \circ \theta</m> (or <m>\theta \circ \phi</m>) producing an "observed behavior profile" in set D. 
            </p>

            <p>
              As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats "playing with toys".  Given that they are cats, 
              I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result.  However, I also restrict their environment
              so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey.  What we percieve as "playing" is really a proxy for murderous
              insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.  
            </p>

            <p>
              I think I can see how this additional structure helped to clarify what had started as an vague idea.  It makes a lot
              more sense to think of mapping from a specific cat to a behavior profile, than trying to map from a cat's behavior 
              profile to a specific environment.
            </p>

          </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
          <title>Exercise 2:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...describe an experiment for deciding whether two nearby points are at the same level..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I feel there's an obvious answer to this question: a level. By using a bit of water in a clear container, you could 
              convievably build a rudamentary level by comparing the slant of the water against a marked line.  The only tricky part
              is designing it so you could align it with the points you want to compare, but the basic idea is that if the points are
              level then the water wouldn't tilt. The authors' use of the word "level" in the prompt makes me think they were heavily
              leading the reader towards something like this.  A level makes it easy to hang pictures expressly because it removes the 
              need to measure up from the floor.

          This is technically my second time through this content and 
I think I made some errors in my original solutions to exercises
2-5.  Rather than ignore my mistakes, I've made the decision to
recreate them here and explain why I think I was wrong afterward. 
I hope this method will give more insight into my thought process. 
To prevent accidental spoilers, this will be treated as a 
"Hidden Exercise 10".

              How many different maps <m>f</m> are there with domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>B</m>?...    
            </p>
          </statement>

            <p>
              So I approached this like I would an algebraic function like 
<m>f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x+2}</m>, but instead of feeding in a number
I'm feeding in John (<m>J</m>), Mary (<m>M</m>) or Sam (<m>S</m>) 
and getting out a breakfast order at a diner that only serves 
eggs (<m>e</m>) or coffee (<m>c</m>) and has a 1 item limit per order.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that the number of outcomes is going to be the same
for each person, so it made sense to focus on one person at
a time.  I imagined John's breakfast order, <m>f(J)</m>, as
having 3 possible outcomes.
            </p>

              Likewise, Mary and Sam have the same 3 possible outcomes: {eggs,coffee,undefined}.
Since these events are independent of each other, the total number of possible

              I thought of this function like the "favorite person" map example from the
reading.  Using John as an example, I imagined 4 possible character roles 
in a hypothetical Hollywood love triangle:
            </p>
<ol>
	<li>John is in love with Mary. <m>f(J)=M</m></li>
	<li>John is in love with Sam.  <m>f(J)=S</m></li>
	<li>John is a narcissist, in love with himself: <m>f(J)=J</m></li>
	<li>John is a psychopath, incapable of love: <m>f(J)</m> is undefined</li>
</ol>
          <p>
            Given an analogous set of 4 outcomes for Mary and Sam, the total number of 
possible plot outcomes is <m>4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64</m>.

            I imagined this one as a "mystery breakfast order".  I'm the a waiter in

John, Mary, and Sam are seated.  The map <m>f</m> tells me who ordered a given
dish.  Like before, I'll consider one example at a time.  There are 4 possible
outcomes for the source of the eggs:  
            </p>
            <ol>
	<li>John ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=J</m></li>
	<li>Mary ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=M</m></li>
	<li>Sam ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=S</m></li>
	<li>Nobody ordered eggs: <m>f(e)</m> is undefined</li>
</ol>	
          <p>
            Since there must likewise be 4 sources for the coffee, the total number of

              At this point I had observed a pattern and attempted to generalize. Following
my reasoning from exercises 2-4, I notice all my answers fit a pattern: 
            </p>
            <me>
(\text{number of maps}) = (1+(\text{size of codomain}))^\text{size of domain}
            </me>
            <p>
              In exercise 5, the size of the domain and codmain would each be 2.  Evaluating
the expression above gives us <m>(1+2)^2=9</m> possible maps.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 6</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
             How many maps <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} A</m> satisfy <m>f \circ f = f</m>?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              This is where I started to notice some problems with my previous reasoning.
In order for me to talk about the properties of <m>f \circ f</m>, it didn't
make sense for <m>f</m> to be "undefined" for an element in my domain.  If
I didn't get something "out", I wouldn't be able to feed it back in.  So
instead of considering all <m>4^3=64</m> possible "love triangles" I identified earlier,
I could narrow my search down to a more limited set of <m>3^3=27</m> maps by 
excluding the "psychopaths" from my romance movies because they make it 
impossible to produce a sequel (more on that idea later).  
            </p>
            <p>
              This narrowed my search, but 27 is still too many for me too sort out by hand so
I started looking for ways to break it down further. I knew I could satisfy the
<m>f \circ f = f</m> constraint with the identity map because clearly
<m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>.  I also know I could satisfy 
<m>f \circ f = f</m> with a "constant function" such as the following: 
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, there would need to be a total of 3 such "constant functions" 
because you'd need one for each of the 3 possible destinations.  At that point
it seemed clear I was still missing some. If I could construct a function 
<m>f</m> with 1 arrow to each point and also a function <m>f</m> with 3 arrows
to a single point, it seemed reasonable to assume there'd be a class of maps
with 2 arrows leading to a single point.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's consider the case where that point with two arrows leading in to 
be "John".  One of the arrows leading to John has to be from himself for
<m>f \circ f (J) = f(J)</m> to be true, but the other arrow could originate at
either Mary or Sam.  Given these two possible maps exist for each person, we'd have
<m>3 \cdot 2 = 6</m> maps of this type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putting everything together, some patterns seem to emerge when I listed these 
out in a table using binomials. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Adding up all of these up gives us total of <m>3+6+1=10</m> possible maps.

            <p>
              This was made even easier by the pattern I noticed in the previous example.
Given that there are only two elements in the domain, there are 
<m>\binom{2}{1}=2</m> maps with 1 fixed point and <m>\binom{2}{2}=1</m> map
with 2 fixed points (namely, <m>1_A</m>) for total of <m>2+1=3</m>.

              None? B has fewer choices in it than A, so when f maps from A to B it must 
destroy at least one of them.  The map g would not be able to produce 3 outputs
from only 2 inputs, so there's no possible way for the composition to cover
all elements of A.

              What first clued me in that my answers to exercises 2-5 might be wrong was 
the hint about "BOOKKEEPING rules" at the very end of the section. Looking
back, it's seem like my programming background may have clouded my 
understanding of "map".  
            </p>
            <p>
              I was thinking about a "map" like I would a "function" in a program.  In this
analogy I had interpreted "domain" as my "input type" and "codomain" as 
"output type".  The flaw in this reasoning is that I was allowing "functions"
to "error", which is not true under the definitions of "map" and "domain" that
were presented.  If the map <m>f(J)</m> produced something "undefined", it 
would be inaccurate to include <m>J</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
          This means that the generalized formula I came up with earlier is "off by 1", 
and the corrected formula should be as follows:    
            </p>
                        <me>
(\text{number of maps}) = (\text{size of codomain})^\text{size of domain}
            </me>
            <p>
              Under these revised definitions, the answers to excercises 2-5 should be as follows:
            </p>
            <table>

          <p>
            I can see why these definitions simplify the process of talking about
"bookkeeping" for the number maps. It's much easier to count the maps 
if we limit ourselves to the ones that are well-formed to start with.  
I'm left wondering if there's a situation where having an "undefined"
output token like I used might be a useful construct, but the costs seem 
to far outweigh the benefits. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I can also see some programming parallels here between the "switch" statement
in C-like languages and the "match" statement in Rust.  The Rust compiler
goes an extra step to verify that every possible outcome has been handled
before even attempting to complile the code you give it.  This provides an
extra level of assurance that these functions will behave as expected.

  in such a way that <m>0^0=1</m>. This is a common practice, but I've also seen
  situations where <m>0^0</m> is left undefined instead.  In this context, the answer
  of 1 to problem 5 makes more sense than than the alternative.  In programming terms,
  it seems perfectly reasonable to think of "no op" as a "function" so there should be
  an analogous "null map" that maps from nothing to nothing.

          This week's reading basically confirmed my generalization from Article 1.  I found it somewhat interesting
          how I instictively happened to use a "vector norm" notation, <m>||A||</m>, for the size of domain and codomain 
          while L&amp;S goes through both "number sign", <m>\#A</m>, and "absolute value", <m>|A|</m>.  It seems so natural
          to want a symbol for "number of elements".

          For present, I suppose I'll follow the book's convention and save myself two extra characters.  It does leave
          me wondering what kind of distance metrics might be useful for talking about the "sameness" of two maps. 
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1</title>
          <statement>

              ...Two of the expressions make sense...

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              So the trick with the map composition is to evaluate them from "right to left".  The expression for (a) 
              of <m>k \circ h \circ g \circ f</m> could be translated into a sequence of steps as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
               Notice how the codomain of each step matches the domain of the following step. Our composite map
               follows a path from 
               <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m>, so it's domain is the "source" <m>A</m>
               and codomain is the "destination" <m>B</m>.  Alternatively written, <m>A \xrightarrow{k \circ h \circ g \circ f} B</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving on to (b), something interesting happens when we attempt to list out the steps of <m>k \circ f \circ g</m>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Apply map <m>B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Notice how the codomain for step 2 of <m>B</m> is not the same as the domain of <m>C</m> in step 3.  This map composition
              is not well defined because the map <m>k</m> will not have a valid input to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having already identified the one that "doesn't make sense", let's move directly onto identifying the domain and codomain 
              of the final composition (c) <m>g \circ f \circ g \circ k \circ h</m>.  Applied from right to left, this gives us:
            </p>
            <me>
              A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A
            </me>
            <p>
              As expected, the domains and codomains link up correctly at each step.  This means that the domain of <m>g \circ f \circ g \circ k \circ h</m> is <m>A</m> (same as the domain of the first map applied, <m>h</m>)
              and the codomain is <m>A</m> (same as the codomain of the last map applied, <m>g</m>).

        <p>
          Time to undo things!  I think I'm coming into this section with a decent grasp of what an
          isomorphism is already, but this idea that there are two inverses instead of just one still
          feels a little weird to me.  I find myself reminding myself that this something I already do, 
          but now I'm just being more specific with my language.  
        </p>
        <p>
          If teaching has taught me anything, it's that people sometimes have very different ideas about
          what is meant by seemingly simple phrases like "the opposite of two".  It's often too easy to fall 
          into a trap in assuming that since I'm thinking of two as a position on the number line and the 
          opposite of that is defined relative to the origin, but "negative two" is really only one possible
          answer.  If the question "what's the oppositve of two?" had beem asked in the kitchen instead of
          a math class, there's a case to be made that "one half" is actually the more appropriate response.
          The opposite of doubling a recipe is halving one.  There might even be situations where it may
          be helpful to think of "opposite" as both the reciprocal and negation, as you would with slopes
          of perpendicular lines. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I think I need to be paying attention to the domains and codomains of the maps because
          that's where I was getting tripped up earlier.

            <p>
              For the reflexive property (R), we can note that <m>A \xrightarrow{1_A} A</m> acts as it's own
              inverse.  Since it leaves every object in place, applying it a second time would also do nothing 
              so <m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>.  If we define <m>f = 1_A</m> and <m>g = 1_A</m>, then the statements
              <m>f \circ g = 1_A</m> and <m>g \circ f = 1_A</m> hold true and <m>1_A</m> is an isomorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the symmetric property (S), we're given that <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m> is an isomorphism with 
              inverse <m>B \xrightarrow{g} A</m>.  By the definition of inverse, we know <m>g \circ f = 1_A</m> and 
              <m>f \circ g = 1_B</m>.  These are precisely the two statements that define <m>B \xrightarrow{g} A</m>
              as the inverse of <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m>, just with the order reversed.  By including both possible
              composition orders in the definition, it guarantees that <m>f</m> is the inverse of <m>g</m> if and only if
              <m>g</m> is the inverse of <m>f</m>.

              <m>f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>, and let <m>C \xrightarrow{k^{-1}} B</m> be the inverse of <m>k</m> such that 
              <m>k^{-1} \circ k = 1_B</m> and <m>k \circ k^{-1} = 1_C</m>.  Consider the composition <m>C \xrightarrow{f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}} A</m>:

              <li>
                Consider <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f)</m>.  By the associative property, we have
                <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f) = f^{-1} \circ (k^{-1} \circ k) \circ f</m>. Since <m>k^{-1} \circ k=1_B</m>, it follows that <m>f^{-1} \circ (k^{-1} \circ k) \circ f = f^{-1} \circ 1_B \circ f = f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m>.

              <li>
                Consider <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1})</m>.  By the associative property, we have
                <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) = k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ k^{-1} </m>.  Since 
                <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>, it follows that <m>k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ k^{-1} = k \circ 1_B \circ k^{-1} = k \circ k^{-1} = 1_C</m>

                Given <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f) = 1_A</m> and <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) = 1_C</m>, we can then
                conclude that <m>A \xrightarrow{k \circ f} C</m> is an isomorphism with an inverse of <m>C \xrightarrow{f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}} A</m>.

              <m>f \circ g = 1_B</m>.  Likewise, <m>B \xrightarrow{k} A</m> being an inverse implies <m>k \circ f = 1_A</m> and

            <p>
              Consider the point: <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)</m>. Since <m>k \circ f = 1_A</m>, we must have 
              <m>(k \circ f)(x_1) = 1_A(x_1) = x_1</m>.  However, since <m>x_1 = g(y)</m> we can also
              write this as <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=(k \circ f)(g(y))</m>.  By the associative property,
              <m>(k \circ f)(g(y))=k(f(g(y))) = k((f \circ g)(y)) = k(1_B(y)) = k(y) = x_2</m>.  Having
              shown that <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=x_1</m> and <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=x_2</m>, this contradicts
              our earlier assumption that <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m> and completes our proof that <m>g=k</m> by
              contradiction.

              Part (a) is given in the text, so lets focus on (b).  If <m>h \circ f = k \circ f</m>, it follows
              that <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = (k \circ f) \circ f^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the associative property, <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = h \circ (f \circ f^{-1})</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>.  Thus,
              <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = h \circ 1_B = h</m>.  By similar reasoning, <m>(k \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) = k \circ 1_B = k</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              It follows that <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = (k \circ f) \circ f^{-1}</m> if and only if <m>h = k</m> which completes our proof.

                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{h} \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>h(x)=x^2</m> does <em>not</em> have a well-defined inverse.  We 
                can't ever recover the negative values after squaring them.

                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{k} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>k(x)=x^2</m> also does <em>not</em> have a well-defined

                <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>l(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}</m> feels like a trick question.  
                For most  intents and purposes, we <em>should</em> have <m>l^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{x}-1</m> but the domain and codomain don't 
                look right here.  Specifically, we have a problem where <m>l^{-1}(0)</m> is undefined and another problem where 
                <m>l^{-1}(x) &lt; 0</m> for <m>x &gt; 1</m>. Based on these observations, I'd have to conclude that <m>l</m> is not invertable.

              One of the way's I think of my inverse function is as "a reflection over the line <m>x=y</m>".  This
              works nicely for a visual confirmation because I can tell that this relationship will hold for the 
              rest of the lines.  My confidence in <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}</m> being invertible is 
              very high.
            </p>

              Notice how the inverse function only replicates half of the parabola when reflected over
              the diagonal. My justification for thinking that (2) is an isomorphism but (3) and (4) are 
              not is that every point in the domain needs to have an inverse that these can be 
              matched up with a point in the codomain (both "onto" and "one-to-one").  By including negative  
              numbers in our domain, we're essentially allowing un-invertable points to be passed in.
            </p>

              Now let's take a look at the final functions:

              On the surface, this looks like precisely the function we're looking for.  It looks
              like a pretty good "mirror image".  The problem comes when consider the domain and 
              codomain.  The map <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m>
              is only valid for positive values, so let's crop and zoom in our previous graph.

              Notice how the graph of <m>\frac{1}{x}-1</m> seemingly has an asymptote at <m>x=0</m>
              and gets "cut-off" when it hits the x-axis.  For us to consider this as an inverse map, 
              the domain of the inverse should match the codomain of the map and vice versa.  Even 
              though these maps meet my reflection criteria, the fact that <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l^{-1}} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> is 
              undefined for <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x &gt; 1</m> when domain and codomain are supposed to 
              both be <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> disqualifies it from being considered an inverse to 
              the map <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps what I should really be doing is looking at the compositions.  We can express
              <m>l \circ l^{-1}</m> as <m>\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{x}-1)+1}</m> or we can express <m>l^{-1} \circ l</m> 
              as <m>\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{x+1})}-1</m>.  These expressions both simplify to just <m>x</m>, but 
              the holes left in the map when we divide by zero at <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=-1</m> don't just disappear.

        <title>Article 2: Isomorphisms, Part 3</title>
        <p>
          As I wrap up Article 2, I keep thinking back to the last expression in Exercise 4 and wonder
          if there's a better way of articulating what I saw.  I'm starting to see more of the connection with the
          injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) properties I typically associate with isomorphisms are  
          effectively guaranteed by the definitions of retraction and section.   
        </p>
        <p>
          I also find the symbol choice of <m>T</m> in this part of Article 2 somewhat curious.  The programmer 
          in me wants to associate <m>T</m> with a "type" or "template", while the mathematician in me is 
          quietly screaming "TOPOLOGY!".  I suppose I'll have to keep going to find out who's right-er.

            Now lets further assume that <m>t_1 \neq t_2</m>, so that we have some <m>b \in B</m>
            such that <m>t_1(b) \neq t_2(b)</m>.  Consider the point defined by <m>s(b)=x</m>.
            If <m>t_1 \circ f = t_2 \circ f</m>, then it must also hold true that
            <m>(t_1 \circ f)(x) = (t_2 \circ f)(x)</m> for all <m>x</m>.  If we expand this,
            we get the following:

          <me>
            (t_1 \circ f)(x) = (t_2 \circ f)(x)

          <me>
            (t_1 \circ f \circ s)(b) = (t_2 \circ f \circ s)(b)

            (t_1 \circ 1_B)(b) = (t_2 \circ 1_B)(b)

            t_1(b) = t_2(b)
          </me>
          <p>
            This contradicts our earlier assumption that <m>t_1 \neq t_2</m> and completes the proof.

              Knowing that <m>r</m> is a retraction of <m>f</m> tells us that <m>r \circ f = 1_A</m>. 
              If we define the map <m>e = f \circ r</m>, we can prove that <m>e \circ e = e</m> through
              the use of the associative property.

              Basically, to go backward to <m>C</m> from <m>A</m>, the order of
              inverses needs to also be reversed. We can prove this algebraically
              also. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>f</m> is an isomorphism, it follows that 
              <m>f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>. Likewise,
              <m>g</m> being an isomorphism implies <m>g^{-1} \circ g = 1_B</m> and
              <m>g \circ g^{-1} = 1_C</m>.  The composition <m>f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}</m>
              can be shown to sasify the conditions for being the inverse of <m>g \circ f</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we must demonstrate that <m>(f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \circ (g \circ f) = 1_A</m>:
            </p>
            <me>(f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \circ (g \circ f)=f^{-1}) \circ (g^{-1} \circ g) \circ f</me>
            <me>= f^{-1} \circ 1_B \circ f</me>
            <me>= f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</me>
            <p>
              Second, we must demonstrate that <m>(g \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) = 1_C</m>:
            </p>
            <me>(g \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) = g \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ g^{-1}</me>
            <me>= g \circ 1_B \circ g^{-1}</me>
            <me>= g \circ g^{-1} = 1_C</me>
            <p>
              This complete our proof that <m>(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}</m>

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Essentially, the number of isomorphisms is a permutation problem.  If 
              we decide on a fixed order of elements in <m>A</m>, each choice uses up
              the respective point in <m>B</m> that it gets matched to.  Therefore, we 
              have 3 choices for Fatima, 2 choices for Omer, and 1 choice for Alysia, or 
              <m>3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6</m> possible choices all together.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number of automorphisms should be the same, namely 6.  It doesn't matter if we're 
              assigning Fatima to <m>\set{Fatima,Omer,Alysia}</m> or <m>\set{coffee,tea,cocoa}</m>,
              it's precisely the same number of choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number 27 in this context is the total number of possible maps from a set of 3 
              elements to another set of 3 elements: <m>3^3 = 27</m>.  This is the formula we arrived
              at after Article 1.  Clearly "the number of invertable maps" should  be less than "the
              total number of maps" because not every map will be invertable.

          While reading this section, I appreciated the fact that "just reverse the arrows" was the official 
          description of isomorphisms on sets. It makes me feel like my answers to Article 2 are at least on the right
          track.  I think my main goal for this week is to better understand what "respects the combining-rules" really means.

              Let's start with <m>h \circ d</m> first.  The composition is applied from right to left, which

              (h \circ d)(x) = h(d(x)) = 0.5(2x) = (0.5 \times 2) x = 1 \times x = x
            </me>
            <p>

              (d \circ h)(x) = d(h(x)) = 2(0.5x) = (2 \times 0.5) x = 1 \times x = x

              Let's start with (a): 
              <m>(\mathbb{R},+) \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} (\mathbb{R},+)</m> given by <m>p(x) = x + 1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              While it seems like "subtract one" would be a reasonable inverse, this is not an isomorphism because 
              it fails to respect the combining-rule <m>p(a+b)=p(a)+p(b)</m>.  Consider the case where <m>a = 1</m> 
              and <m>b = 2</m>. We have <m>p(a)=2</m> and <m>p(b)=3</m> so <m>p(a)+p(b)=5</m>.  However, this is not 
              the same as <m>p(a+b)</m>, which evaluates to <m>p(1+2) = p(3) = 4</m> instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              The map in (b) and the map in (c) are both closely related because they share a common definition of <m>sq(x) = x^2</m>,
              but differ in the domain and codomain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again there's an obvious inverse function of "square root", but the domains and codomains 
              are what concern me.  Notable about (b) is that it fails to map "onto" the entire codomain, because the <m>sq</m> map 
              never produces any negative numbers as an output.  The map in (c) resolves this by limiting the codomain to non-negative
              values, but it still fails to "one-to-one" because both 1 and -1 produce an output of 1.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The map in (d) and (e) likewise have similar definitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The map defined by the given expression <m>m x = -x</m> acts as its own inverse:
              <m>(m \circ m) (x) = m(m(x)) = m(-x) = -(-x) = x</m>.  Where (d) and (e) differ
              is in the "combining-rule".  If we have <m>\set{a,b} \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then a little algebra can show that
              <m>m(a+b) = -(a+b) = (-a)+(-b) = m(a)+m(b)</m>.  This means that both the identity rules and the combining-rules are 
              satisfied for (d), making it the only genuine isomorphism in the list. The map in (e) fails to uphold the combining rule 
              because <m>m(a \times b) \neq m(a) \times m(b)</m>.  In the case where 
              <m>a = 1</m> and <m>b = -1</m>, we have <m>m(a \times b) = -(1 \times (-1)) = -(-1) = 1</m> 
              but <m>m(a) \times m(b) = -1 \times 1 = -1</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally we have the map (f), which isn't even a map with the specified domain and codomain because the cube of a
              negative number is still negative.  Had the map been defined with the correct codomain, 
              <m>(\mathbb{R},\times) \overset{c}{\longrightarrow} (\mathbb{R},\times)</m>, then we'd potentially be able to define
              an inverse map by using the "cube root" function.

          As I was proof reading this session, I noticed a couple small errors in the 3rd exercise.  One of these was a misread problem, 
          but the other was a little more subtle.  In an effort to get the most out of this as a learning experience,  I thought it
          might be valuable to talk about what I learned from my mistakes.
        </p>
        <example>

          <statement>
            <p>
              As I was proof reading, I noticed an error in Exercise 3 Part (e).  It was a simple case of me not reading 
              the question as precisely as needed. I think I was so excited to show (d) was an isomorphism that I didn't 
              give (e) the amount of skepticism it deserved.  I mistakely read the domain as <m>(\mathbb{R},+)</m> instead
              of <m>(\mathbb{R},\times)</m> which made finding a counter-example trivial relative to the actual problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As I was looking over my solution to fix this, I noticed something else kind of odd. My solution began with
              "Let's go one at a time" but I had addressed some of the problems in pairs.  There's something that felt natural 
              about approaching them this way, but it also seemed kind of ironic that I had failed to produce a isomorphism
              between my problems and solutions in a section that was all about matching things up.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this started to get my thinking about the solutions to these problems as a map
              <m>\set{a,b,c,d,e,f} \overset{s}{\longrightarrow} \set{isomorphism,non-isomorphism}</m>.  
              Obviously this map is not invertable, but it made me wonder if the "Hints" to this section
              provided sufficient information about the functions to identify each one.  Is there some
              set of descriptions that would establish a one-to-one relationship with these problems?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The first hint tells us that only one of these maps is a "genuine isomorphism", which I concluded was (d). 
              The last hint says that one is "not even a map", which I concluded is (f). The hint that 
              "[s]ome... dont respect the combining rules" explains why I rejected (a) and (e).  It also seems natural
              to ask "does it have a section?" and "does it have a retraction?".

              These four questions are <em>almost</em> enough to identify every problem except for distinguishing between
              (a) and (e).  The best description of the difference is that (a) fails to preserve the combining-rules 
              <em>in every case</em> while (e) might pass or fail the combining-rules depending on its input.  This is 
              a very subtle difference that I probably would have overlooked had I not made the mistake that I did.

              there exists some pair of points <m>\mathbf{1} \longrightarrow A</m> such that <m>fa_1 = fa_2</m>

              In this situation, there's no possible map <m>g</m> here with <m>h = g \circ f</m> because <m>g</m> can't send

            <p>
              In this situation, we can construct a map <m>g</m> that has our desired property <m>g \circ f = h</m>.
              I'd imagine it like taking an image of the maps <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> over the set <m>A = \set{a_1,a_2,a_3,...}</m>
              and defining <m>g</m> as by the collection of arrows that have an origin at <m>fa_i</m> and destination <m>ha_i</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously defining <m>g</m> in this way will potentially leave the possibility of arrows having duplicates,
              but the property <m>(fa_1 = fa_2) \Rightarrow (ha_1 = ha_2)</m> ensures that if any two arrows share the same
              origin they must share the same destination.  
            </p>
            <p>
              From a meta-perspective, it makes sense that the converse holds true for use to this practically as a definition. When
              we say "<m>h</m> is determined by <m>f</m>", we want it to be true if and only if it satisfies the properties
              we've defined it to have.
            </p>
          </solution>

          <title>Exercise 2</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Show that... there is at least one <m>b</m> in <m>B</m> for which <m>h(a) = g(b)</m>...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I think the key idea in part (a) here is that the point <m>f(a)</m> precisely satisfies the properties
              we want for establishing the existence of <m>b</m>.  As long as there is some map <m>f</m> with 
              <m>g \circ f = h</m> then we can define <m>b = f(a)</m> and it follows directly that 
              <m>h(a) = (g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b)</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proving the converse in (b) seems a little trickier.  I think I'd want to approach this like 
              I did with "Exercise 1" and consider making an image by applying <m>g</m> to each element 
              <m>b_1,b_2,... \in \mathbf{1} \longrightarrow B</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we already know that for each <m>gb_i</m> there is at least one <m>a_i</m> such that
              <m>ha_i = gb_i</m>, we can begin to construct a map <m>f</m> by creating a collection of
              arrows with origin <m>a_i</m> and destination <m>b_i</m>.

              The left arrow needs to have one of four possible destinations, since there are four points in A that get 
              mapped there by <m>f</m>.  The right arrow needs to have one of two possible destination from the points 
              stacked above it.  Since these choices are independent, we're looking for a total of <m>4 \times 2 = 8</m> maps.

        Upon finishing the exercises, I've chosen to not to retract my sarcastic pun above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, yeah, that's partly because I'm lazy, but I think it's also a good metaphor for what 
        I learned about this week.  Writing these posts is a multi-stage process that resembles a
        sequence of map compositions.  I read (at least some of) the section, work out the exercises, 
        then come back and revise.  What you see at the end is the composition, but not necessarily
        each step along the way. At the same time, some qualities of the end product itself may 
        restrict the process leading to it but others leave flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week's reading seemed to be about exactly how flexible these maps could be before they
        start to lose information.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I could have removed the remark at the start of this and replaced it with something else. Yet, 
        the fact that I'm now discussing it means it <em>must</em> be there.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems exceptionally well fitting to how my proofs this week worked.  I'm essentially arguing
        that these maps exists because I can describe a set of rules to construct them. Whether you believe
        me or not, well, that's another story...
