      <section xml:id="about">
        <title>What is this?</title>
        <p>I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein "L&amp;S") on my own and it's been kind of difficult.  
          Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an
          effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with <pretext />.  
          I've done a lot of work using <latex/> for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering 
          diagrams with the TiKz package.  
        </p>
        <p>To start, I went through my old notes on L&amp;S from my first attempted reading. It looks like I made to to around session 11 before I started really getting lost. 
          Furthermore, the erasable ink I had used to solve the exercises originally had faded significantly since I originally worked on
          this.   
          Since I'm expecting one of my major difficulties with this to be recreating the diagrams, I figured restarting from the very beginning would
          be the best way forward.
        </p>
        <p>I know myself better than to make promises about the rate I get through this, but part of me thinks it would be fun to do "cat theory on caturday". 
         Giving myself a day of the week to finish by might give me the push I need to get it done.  Besides, everything is better with cats.  
        </p>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="session1">
        <title>Session 1</title>
        <p>
          Since L&amp;S start Session 1 prior to "Part 1", I figured I should do the same.  I'm presuming the reader has access to
          the source material and hope that my abbreviated reproduction of the prompts this way is "fair use".  After all, calling them "exercises"
          implies they're meant for me to work out, no?
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...other examples of combining two objects to get a third..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps
              <m>BEHAVIOR=NATURE \times NURTURE</m> might satisfy the pattern here.  The way my cats seem to behave is
              based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment 
              where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, 
              however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the "maps".  
            </p>
            <p>
              The diagrams in session 1 had the following structure:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-cd">
              <caption>A typical diagram of the examples considered in L&amp;S "Session 1"</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-cd">
            
            <latex-image>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\node (A) at (0,1) {$A$};
\node (B) at (1,1) {$B$};
\node (C) at (0,0) {$C$};
\path[->,font=\scriptsize,>=angle 90]
(A) edge node[above]{$\phi$} (B)
(A) edge node[right]{$\theta$} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
              </image>
            
            </figure>
            <p>
            It didn't really make sense to me to think of "behavior" as A in this diagram and nature/nuture as B/C because 
            I could think of many situations where a single behavior might make sense in different environments. It seems 
            more natural to think of behavior as function of environment rather than the environment as a function of the
            behavior. I feel like the qualities I identified might more accurately be arranged like so:
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-session1-alt">
              <caption>Alternate explanation structure of behavior (A), nature (B), and nurture (C)</caption>
              <image width="20%" xml:id="img-session1-alt">
            
            <latex-image>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
              I think some of this unease comes from the complexity associated with behavior.  I think on some level I'm confusing 
              a "behavioral genotype" with a "behavioral phenotype".  Being a cat creates a behavior profile of the actions they
              might engage in, but the environment selects for which actions are allowed to manifest. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's define <m>A</m> as "the set of animals".  We can consider "instincts" as a map <m>\phi</m> that maps each animal to its
              "natural behavior profile" in set B.  We can also consider "selection" as a map <m>\theta</m> that maps each animal to an 
              "environmental reward profile" in set C.  Under these definitions, it seems reasonable to think of the composite 
              map <m>\phi \circ \theta</m> (or <m>\theta \circ \phi</m>) producing an "observed behavior profile" in set D. 
            </p>

            <p>
              As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats "playing with toys".  Given that they are cats, 
              I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result.  However, I also restrict their environment
              so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey.  What we percieve as "playing" is really a proxy for murderous
              insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.  
            </p>

            <p>
              I think I can see how this additional structure helped to clarify what had started as an vague idea.  It makes a lot
              more sense to think of mapping from a specific cat to a behavior profile, than trying to map from a cat's behavior 
              profile to a specific environment.
            </p>

          </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
          <title>Exercise 2:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              "...describe an experiment for deciding whether two nearby points are at the same level..."
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I feel there's an obvious answer to this question: a level. By using a bit of water in a clear container, you could 
              convievably build a rudamentary level by comparing the slant of the water against a marked line.  The only tricky part
              is designing it so you could align it with the points you want to compare, but the basic idea is that if the points are
              level then the water wouldn't tilt. The authors' use of the word "level" in the prompt makes me think they were heavily
              leading the reader towards something like this.  A level makes it easy to hang pictures expressly because it removes the 
              need to measure up from the floor.

          This is technically my second time through this content and 
I think I made some errors in my original solutions to exercises
2-5.  Rather than ignore my mistakes, I've made the decision to
recreate them here and explain why I think I was wrong afterward. 
I hope this method will give more insight into my thought process. 
To prevent accidental spoilers, this will be treated as a 
"Hidden Exercise 10".

              How many different maps <m>f</m> are there with domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>B</m>?...    
            </p>
          </statement>

            <p>
              So I approached this like I would an algebraic function like 
<m>f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x+2}</m>, but instead of feeding in a number
I'm feeding in John (<m>J</m>), Mary (<m>M</m>) or Sam (<m>S</m>) 
and getting out a breakfast order at a diner that only serves 
eggs (<m>e</m>) or coffee (<m>c</m>) and has a 1 item limit per order.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that the number of outcomes is going to be the same
for each person, so it made sense to focus on one person at
a time.  I imagined John's breakfast order, <m>f(J)</m>, as
having 3 possible outcomes.
            </p>

              Likewise, Mary and Sam have the same 3 possible outcomes: {eggs,coffee,undefined}.
Since these events are independent of each other, the total number of possible

              I thought of this function like the "favorite person" map example from the
reading.  Using John as an example, I imagined 4 possible character roles 
in a hypothetical Hollywood love triangle:
            </p>
<ol>
	<li>John is in love with Mary. <m>f(J)=M</m></li>
	<li>John is in love with Sam.  <m>f(J)=S</m></li>
	<li>John is a narcissist, in love with himself: <m>f(J)=J</m></li>
	<li>John is a psychopath, incapable of love: <m>f(J)</m> is undefined</li>
</ol>
          <p>
            Given an analogous set of 4 outcomes for Mary and Sam, the total number of 
possible plot outcomes is <m>4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64</m>.

            I imagined this one as a "mystery breakfast order".  I'm the a waiter in

John, Mary, and Sam are seated.  The map <m>f</m> tells me who ordered a given
dish.  Like before, I'll consider one example at a time.  There are 4 possible
outcomes for the source of the eggs:  
            </p>
            <ol>
	<li>John ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=J</m></li>
	<li>Mary ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=M</m></li>
	<li>Sam ordered the eggs: <m>f(e)=S</m></li>
	<li>Nobody ordered eggs: <m>f(e)</m> is undefined</li>
</ol>	
          <p>
            Since there must likewise be 4 sources for the coffee, the total number of

              At this point I had observed a pattern and attempted to generalize. Following
my reasoning from exercises 2-4, I notice all my answers fit a pattern: 
            </p>
            <me>
(\text{number of maps}) = (1+(\text{size of codomain}))^\text{size of domain}
            </me>
            <p>
              In exercise 5, the size of the domain and codmain would each be 2.  Evaluating
the expression above gives us <m>(1+2)^2=9</m> possible maps.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 6</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
             How many maps <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} A</m> satisfy <m>f \circ f = f</m>?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              This is where I started to notice some problems with my previous reasoning.
In order for me to talk about the properties of <m>f \circ f</m>, it didn't
make sense for <m>f</m> to be "undefined" for an element in my domain.  If
I didn't get something "out", I wouldn't be able to feed it back in.  So
instead of considering all <m>4^3=64</m> possible "love triangles" I identified earlier,
I could narrow my search down to a more limited set of <m>3^3=27</m> maps by 
excluding the "psychopaths" from my romance movies because they make it 
impossible to produce a sequel (more on that idea later).  
            </p>
            <p>
              This narrowed my search, but 27 is still too many for me too sort out by hand so
I started looking for ways to break it down further. I knew I could satisfy the
<m>f \circ f = f</m> constraint with the identity map because clearly
<m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>.  I also know I could satisfy 
<m>f \circ f = f</m> with a "constant function" such as the following: 
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, there would need to be a total of 3 such "constant functions" 
because you'd need one for each of the 3 possible destinations.  At that point
it seemed clear I was still missing some. If I could construct a function 
<m>f</m> with 1 arrow to each point and also a function <m>f</m> with 3 arrows
to a single point, it seemed reasonable to assume there'd be a class of maps
with 2 arrows leading to a single point.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's consider the case where that point with two arrows leading in to 
be "John".  One of the arrows leading to John has to be from himself for
<m>f \circ f (J) = f(J)</m> to be true, but the other arrow could originate at
either Mary or Sam.  Given these two possible maps exist for each person, we'd have
<m>3 \cdot 2 = 6</m> maps of this type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putting everything together, some patterns seem to emerge when I listed these 
out in a table using binomials. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Adding up all of these up gives us total of <m>3+6+1=10</m> possible maps.

            <p>
              This was made even easier by the pattern I noticed in the previous example.
Given that there are only two elements in the domain, there are 
<m>\binom{2}{1}=2</m> maps with 1 fixed point and <m>\binom{2}{2}=1</m> map
with 2 fixed points (namely, <m>1_A</m>) for total of <m>2+1=3</m>.

              None? B has fewer choices in it than A, so when f maps from A to B it must 
destroy at least one of them.  The map g would not be able to produce 3 outputs
from only 2 inputs, so there's no possible way for the composition to cover
all elements of A.

              What first clued me in that my answers to exercises 2-5 might be wrong was 
the hint about "BOOKKEEPING rules" at the very end of the section. Looking
back, it's seem like my programming background may have clouded my 
understanding of "map".  
            </p>
            <p>
              I was thinking about a "map" like I would a "function" in a program.  In this
analogy I had interpreted "domain" as my "input type" and "codomain" as 
"output type".  The flaw in this reasoning is that I was allowing "functions"
to "error", which is not true under the definitions of "map" and "domain" that
were presented.  If the map <m>f(J)</m> produced something "undefined", it 
would be inaccurate to include <m>J</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
          This means that the generalized formula I came up with earlier is "off by 1", 
and the corrected formula should be as follows:    
            </p>
                        <me>
(\text{number of maps}) = (\text{size of codomain})^\text{size of domain}
            </me>
            <p>
              Under these revised definitions, the answers to excercises 2-5 should be as follows:
            </p>
            <table>

          <p>
            I can see why these definitions simplify the process of talking about
"bookkeeping" for the number maps. It's much easier to count the maps 
if we limit ourselves to the ones that are well-formed to start with.  
I'm left wondering if there's a situation where having an "undefined"
output token like I used might be a useful construct, but the costs seem 
to far outweigh the benefits. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I can also see some programming parallels here between the "switch" statement
in C-like languages and the "match" statement in Rust.  The Rust compiler
goes an extra step to verify that every possible outcome has been handled
before even attempting to complile the code you give it.  This provides an
extra level of assurance that these functions will behave as expected.

  in such a way that <m>0^0=1</m>. This is a common practice, but I've also seen
  situations where <m>0^0</m> is left undefined instead.  In this context, the answer
  of 1 to problem 5 makes more sense than than the alternative.  In programming terms,
  it seems perfectly reasonable to think of "no op" as a "function" so there should be
  an analogous "null map" that maps from nothing to nothing.

          This week's reading basically confirmed my generalization from Article 1.  I found it somewhat interesting
          how I instictively happened to use a "vector norm" notation, <m>||A||</m>, for the size of domain and codomain 
          while L&amp;S goes through both "number sign", <m>\#A</m>, and "absolute value", <m>|A|</m>.  It seems so natural
          to want a symbol for "number of elements".

          For present, I suppose I'll follow the book's convention and save myself two extra characters.  It does leave
          me wondering what kind of distance metrics might be useful for talking about the "sameness" of two maps. 
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1</title>
          <statement>

              ...Two of the expressions make sense...

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              So the trick with the map composition is to evaluate them from "right to left".  The expression for (a) 
              of <m>k \circ h \circ g \circ f</m> could be translated into a sequence of steps as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
               Notice how the codomain of each step matches the domain of the following step. Our composite map
               follows a path from 
               <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m>, so it's domain is the "source" <m>A</m>
               and codomain is the "destination" <m>B</m>.  Alternatively written, <m>A \xrightarrow{k \circ h \circ g \circ f} B</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving on to (b), something interesting happens when we attempt to list out the steps of <m>k \circ f \circ g</m>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Apply map <m>B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
              <li>Apply map <m>C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B</m></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Notice how the codomain for step 2 of <m>B</m> is not the same as the domain of <m>C</m> in step 3.  This map composition
              is not well defined because the map <m>k</m> will not have a valid input to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having already identified the one that "doesn't make sense", let's move directly onto identifying the domain and codomain 
              of the final composition (c) <m>g \circ f \circ g \circ k \circ h</m>.  Applied from right to left, this gives us:
            </p>
            <me>
              A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} C \overset{k}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} A
            </me>
            <p>
              As expected, the domains and codomains link up correctly at each step.  This means that the domain of <m>g \circ f \circ g \circ k \circ h</m> is <m>A</m> (same as the domain of the first map applied, <m>h</m>)
              and the codomain is <m>A</m> (same as the codomain of the last map applied, <m>g</m>).

        <p>
          Time to undo things!  I think I'm coming into this section with a decent grasp of what an
          isomorphism is already, but this idea that there are two inverses instead of just one still
          feels a little weird to me.  I find myself reminding myself that this something I already do, 
          but now I'm just being more specific with my language.  
        </p>
        <p>
          If teaching has taught me anything, it's that people sometimes have very different ideas about
          what is meant by seemingly simple phrases like "the opposite of two".  It's often too easy to fall 
          into a trap in assuming that since I'm thinking of two as a position on the number line and the 
          opposite of that is defined relative to the origin, but "negative two" is really only one possible
          answer.  If the question "what's the oppositve of two?" had beem asked in the kitchen instead of
          a math class, there's a case to be made that "one half" is actually the more appropriate response.
          The opposite of doubling a recipe is halving one.  There might even be situations where it may
          be helpful to think of "opposite" as both the reciprocal and negation, as you would with slopes
          of perpendicular lines. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I think I need to be paying attention to the domains and codomains of the maps because
          that's where I was getting tripped up earlier.

            <p>
              For the reflexive property (R), we can note that <m>A \xrightarrow{1_A} A</m> acts as it's own
              inverse.  Since it leaves every object in place, applying it a second time would also do nothing 
              so <m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>.  If we define <m>f = 1_A</m> and <m>g = 1_A</m>, then the statements
              <m>f \circ g = 1_A</m> and <m>g \circ f = 1_A</m> hold true and <m>1_A</m> is an isomorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the symmetric property (S), we're given that <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m> is an isomorphism with 
              inverse <m>B \xrightarrow{g} A</m>.  By the definition of inverse, we know <m>g \circ f = 1_A</m> and 
              <m>f \circ g = 1_B</m>.  These are precisely the two statements that define <m>B \xrightarrow{g} A</m>
              as the inverse of <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m>, just with the order reversed.  By including both possible
              composition orders in the definition, it guarantees that <m>f</m> is the inverse of <m>g</m> if and only if
              <m>g</m> is the inverse of <m>f</m>.

              <m>f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>, and let <m>C \xrightarrow{k^{-1}} B</m> be the inverse of <m>k</m> such that 
              <m>k^{-1} \circ k = 1_B</m> and <m>k \circ k^{-1} = 1_C</m>.  Consider the composition <m>C \xrightarrow{f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}} A</m>:

              <li>
                Consider <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f)</m>.  By the associative property, we have
                <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f) = f^{-1} \circ (k^{-1} \circ k) \circ f</m>. Since <m>k^{-1} \circ k=1_B</m>, it follows that <m>f^{-1} \circ (k^{-1} \circ k) \circ f = f^{-1} \circ 1_B \circ f = f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m>.

              <li>
                Consider <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1})</m>.  By the associative property, we have
                <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) = k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ k^{-1} </m>.  Since 
                <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>, it follows that <m>k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ k^{-1} = k \circ 1_B \circ k^{-1} = k \circ k^{-1} = 1_C</m>

                Given <m>(f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) \circ (k \circ f) = 1_A</m> and <m>(k \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}) = 1_C</m>, we can then
                conclude that <m>A \xrightarrow{k \circ f} C</m> is an isomorphism with an inverse of <m>C \xrightarrow{f^{-1} \circ k^{-1}} A</m>.

              <m>f \circ g = 1_B</m>.  Likewise, <m>B \xrightarrow{k} A</m> being an inverse implies <m>k \circ f = 1_A</m> and

            <p>
              Consider the point: <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)</m>. Since <m>k \circ f = 1_A</m>, we must have 
              <m>(k \circ f)(x_1) = 1_A(x_1) = x_1</m>.  However, since <m>x_1 = g(y)</m> we can also
              write this as <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=(k \circ f)(g(y))</m>.  By the associative property,
              <m>(k \circ f)(g(y))=k(f(g(y))) = k((f \circ g)(y)) = k(1_B(y)) = k(y) = x_2</m>.  Having
              shown that <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=x_1</m> and <m>(k \circ f)(x_1)=x_2</m>, this contradicts
              our earlier assumption that <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m> and completes our proof that <m>g=k</m> by
              contradiction.

              Part (a) is given in the text, so lets focus on (b).  If <m>h \circ f = k \circ f</m>, it follows
              that <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = (k \circ f) \circ f^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the associative property, <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = h \circ (f \circ f^{-1})</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>.  Thus,
              <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = h \circ 1_B = h</m>.  By similar reasoning, <m>(k \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = k \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) = k \circ 1_B = k</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              It follows that <m>(h \circ f) \circ f^{-1} = (k \circ f) \circ f^{-1}</m> if and only if <m>h = k</m> which completes our proof.

                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{h} \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>h(x)=x^2</m> does <em>not</em> have a well-defined inverse.  We 
                can't ever recover the negative values after squaring them.

                <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{k} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>k(x)=x^2</m> also does <em>not</em> have a well-defined

                <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> with <m>l(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}</m> feels like a trick question.  
                For most  intents and purposes, we <em>should</em> have <m>l^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{x}-1</m> but the domain and codomain don't 
                look right here.  Specifically, we have a problem where <m>l^{-1}(0)</m> is undefined and another problem where 
                <m>l^{-1}(x) &lt; 0</m> for <m>x &gt; 1</m>. Based on these observations, I'd have to conclude that <m>l</m> is not invertable.

              One of the way's I think of my inverse function is as "a reflection over the line <m>x=y</m>".  This
              works nicely for a visual confirmation because I can tell that this relationship will hold for the 
              rest of the lines.  My confidence in <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}</m> being invertible is 
              very high.
            </p>

              Notice how the inverse function only replicates half of the parabola when reflected over
              the diagonal. My justification for thinking that (2) is an isomorphism but (3) and (4) are 
              not is that every point in the domain needs to have an inverse that these can be 
              matched up with a point in the codomain (both "onto" and "one-to-one").  By including negative  
              numbers in our domain, we're essentially allowing un-invertable points to be passed in.
            </p>

              Now let's take a look at the final functions:

              On the surface, this looks like precisely the function we're looking for.  It looks
              like a pretty good "mirror image".  The problem comes when consider the domain and 
              codomain.  The map <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m>
              is only valid for positive values, so let's crop and zoom in our previous graph.

              Notice how the graph of <m>\frac{1}{x}-1</m> seemingly has an asymptote at <m>x=0</m>
              and gets "cut-off" when it hits the x-axis.  For us to consider this as an inverse map, 
              the domain of the inverse should match the codomain of the map and vice versa.  Even 
              though these maps meet my reflection criteria, the fact that <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l^{-1}} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> is 
              undefined for <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x &gt; 1</m> when domain and codomain are supposed to 
              both be <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> disqualifies it from being considered an inverse to 
              the map <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps what I should really be doing is looking at the compositions.  We can express
              <m>l \circ l^{-1}</m> as <m>\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{x}-1)+1}</m> or we can express <m>l^{-1} \circ l</m> 
              as <m>\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{x+1})}-1</m>.  These expressions both simplify to just <m>x</m>, but 
              the holes left in the map when we divide by zero at <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=-1</m> don't just disappear.

        <title>Article 2: Isomorphisms, Part 3</title>
        <p>
          As I wrap up Article 2, I keep thinking back to the last expression in Exercise 4 and wonder
          if there's a better way of articulating what I saw.  I'm starting to see more of the connection with the
          injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) properties I typically associate with isomorphisms are  
          effectively guaranteed by the definitions of retraction and section.   
        </p>
        <p>
          I also find the symbol choice of <m>T</m> in this part of Article 2 somewhat curious.  The programmer 
          in me wants to associate <m>T</m> with a "type" or "template", while the mathematician in me is 
          quietly screaming "TOPOLOGY!".  I suppose I'll have to keep going to find out who's right-er.

            Now lets further assume that <m>t_1 \neq t_2</m>, so that we have some <m>b \in B</m>
            such that <m>t_1(b) \neq t_2(b)</m>.  Consider the point defined by <m>s(b)=x</m>.
            If <m>t_1 \circ f = t_2 \circ f</m>, then it must also hold true that
            <m>(t_1 \circ f)(x) = (t_2 \circ f)(x)</m> for all <m>x</m>.  If we expand this,
            we get the following:

          <me>
            (t_1 \circ f)(x) = (t_2 \circ f)(x)

          <me>
            (t_1 \circ f \circ s)(b) = (t_2 \circ f \circ s)(b)

            (t_1 \circ 1_B)(b) = (t_2 \circ 1_B)(b)

            t_1(b) = t_2(b)
          </me>
          <p>
            This contradicts our earlier assumption that <m>t_1 \neq t_2</m> and completes the proof.

              Knowing that <m>r</m> is a retraction of <m>f</m> tells us that <m>r \circ f = 1_A</m>. 
              If we define the map <m>e = f \circ r</m>, we can prove that <m>e \circ e = e</m> through
              the use of the associative property.

              Basically, to go backward to <m>C</m> from <m>A</m>, the order of
              inverses needs to also be reversed. We can prove this algebraically
              also. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>f</m> is an isomorphism, it follows that 
              <m>f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_B</m>. Likewise,
              <m>g</m> being an isomorphism implies <m>g^{-1} \circ g = 1_B</m> and
              <m>g \circ g^{-1} = 1_C</m>.  The composition <m>f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}</m>
              can be shown to sasify the conditions for being the inverse of <m>g \circ f</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we must demonstrate that <m>(f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \circ (g \circ f) = 1_A</m>:
            </p>
            <me>(f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \circ (g \circ f)=f^{-1}) \circ (g^{-1} \circ g) \circ f</me>
            <me>= f^{-1} \circ 1_B \circ f</me>
            <me>= f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</me>
            <p>
              Second, we must demonstrate that <m>(g \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) = 1_C</m>:
            </p>
            <me>(g \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) = g \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) \circ g^{-1}</me>
            <me>= g \circ 1_B \circ g^{-1}</me>
            <me>= g \circ g^{-1} = 1_C</me>
            <p>
              This complete our proof that <m>(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}</m>

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Essentially, the number of isomorphisms is a permutation problem.  If 
              we decide on a fixed order of elements in <m>A</m>, each choice uses up
              the respective point in <m>B</m> that it gets matched to.  Therefore, we 
              have 3 choices for Fatima, 2 choices for Omer, and 1 choice for Alysia, or 
              <m>3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6</m> possible choices all together.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number of automorphisms should be the same, namely 6.  It doesn't matter if we're 
              assigning Fatima to <m>\set{Fatima,Omer,Alysia}</m> or <m>\set{coffee,tea,cocoa}</m>,
              it's precisely the same number of choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number 27 in this context is the total number of possible maps from a set of 3 
              elements to another set of 3 elements: <m>3^3 = 27</m>.  This is the formula we arrived
              at after Article 1.  Clearly "the number of invertable maps" should  be less than "the
              total number of maps" because not every map will be invertable.

          While reading this section, I appreciated the fact that "just reverse the arrows" was the official 
          description of isomorphisms on sets. It makes me feel like my answers to Article 2 are at least on the right
          track.  I think my main goal for this week is to better understand what "respects the combining-rules" really means.

              Let's start with <m>h \circ d</m> first.  The composition is applied from right to left, which

              (h \circ d)(x) = h(d(x)) = 0.5(2x) = (0.5 \times 2) x = 1 \times x = x
            </me>
            <p>

              (d \circ h)(x) = d(h(x)) = 2(0.5x) = (2 \times 0.5) x = 1 \times x = x

              Let's start with (a): 
              <m>(\mathbb{R},+) \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} (\mathbb{R},+)</m> given by <m>p(x) = x + 1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              While it seems like "subtract one" would be a reasonable inverse, this is not an isomorphism because 
              it fails to respect the combining-rule <m>p(a+b)=p(a)+p(b)</m>.  Consider the case where <m>a = 1</m> 
              and <m>b = 2</m>. We have <m>p(a)=2</m> and <m>p(b)=3</m> so <m>p(a)+p(b)=5</m>.  However, this is not 
              the same as <m>p(a+b)</m>, which evaluates to <m>p(1+2) = p(3) = 4</m> instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              The map in (b) and the map in (c) are both closely related because they share a common definition of <m>sq(x) = x^2</m>,
              but differ in the domain and codomain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again there's an obvious inverse function of "square root", but the domains and codomains 
              are what concern me.  Notable about (b) is that it fails to map "onto" the entire codomain, because the <m>sq</m> map 
              never produces any negative numbers as an output.  The map in (c) resolves this by limiting the codomain to non-negative
              values, but it still fails to "one-to-one" because both 1 and -1 produce an output of 1.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The map in (d) and (e) likewise have similar definitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The map defined by the given expression <m>m x = -x</m> acts as its own inverse:
              <m>(m \circ m) (x) = m(m(x)) = m(-x) = -(-x) = x</m>.  Where (d) and (e) differ
              is in the "combining-rule".  If we have <m>\set{a,b} \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then a little algebra can show that
              <m>m(a+b) = -(a+b) = (-a)+(-b) = m(a)+m(b)</m>.  This means that both the identity rules and the combining-rules are 
              satisfied for (d), making it the only genuine isomorphism in the list. The map in (e) fails to uphold the combining rule 
              because <m>m(a \times b) \neq m(a) \times m(b)</m>.  In the case where 
              <m>a = 1</m> and <m>b = -1</m>, we have <m>m(a \times b) = -(1 \times (-1)) = -(-1) = 1</m> 
              but <m>m(a) \times m(b) = -1 \times 1 = -1</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally we have the map (f), which isn't even a map with the specified domain and codomain because the cube of a
              negative number is still negative.  Had the map been defined with the correct codomain, 
              <m>(\mathbb{R},\times) \overset{c}{\longrightarrow} (\mathbb{R},\times)</m>, then we'd potentially be able to define
              an inverse map by using the "cube root" function.

          As I was proof reading this session, I noticed a couple small errors in the 3rd exercise.  One of these was a misread problem, 
          but the other was a little more subtle.  In an effort to get the most out of this as a learning experience,  I thought it
          might be valuable to talk about what I learned from my mistakes.
        </p>
        <example>

          <statement>
            <p>
              As I was proof reading, I noticed an error in Exercise 3 Part (e).  It was a simple case of me not reading 
              the question as precisely as needed. I think I was so excited to show (d) was an isomorphism that I didn't 
              give (e) the amount of skepticism it deserved.  I mistakely read the domain as <m>(\mathbb{R},+)</m> instead
              of <m>(\mathbb{R},\times)</m> which made finding a counter-example trivial relative to the actual problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As I was looking over my solution to fix this, I noticed something else kind of odd. My solution began with
              "Let's go one at a time" but I had addressed some of the problems in pairs.  There's something that felt natural 
              about approaching them this way, but it also seemed kind of ironic that I had failed to produce a isomorphism
              between my problems and solutions in a section that was all about matching things up.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this started to get my thinking about the solutions to these problems as a map
              <m>\set{a,b,c,d,e,f} \overset{s}{\longrightarrow} \set{isomorphism,non-isomorphism}</m>.  
              Obviously this map is not invertable, but it made me wonder if the "Hints" to this section
              provided sufficient information about the functions to identify each one.  Is there some
              set of descriptions that would establish a one-to-one relationship with these problems?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The first hint tells us that only one of these maps is a "genuine isomorphism", which I concluded was (d). 
              The last hint says that one is "not even a map", which I concluded is (f). The hint that 
              "[s]ome... dont respect the combining rules" explains why I rejected (a) and (e).  It also seems natural
              to ask "does it have a section?" and "does it have a retraction?".

              These four questions are <em>almost</em> enough to identify every problem except for distinguishing between
              (a) and (e).  The best description of the difference is that (a) fails to preserve the combining-rules 
              <em>in every case</em> while (e) might pass or fail the combining-rules depending on its input.  This is 
              a very subtle difference that I probably would have overlooked had I not made the mistake that I did.

              In this situation, there's no possible map <m>g</m> here with <m>h = g \circ f</m> because <m>g</m> can't send

            <p>
              In this situation, we can construct a map <m>g</m> that has our desired property <m>g \circ f = h</m>.
              I'd imagine it like taking an image of the maps <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> over the set <m>A = \set{a_1,a_2,a_3,...}</m>
              and defining <m>g</m> as by the collection of arrows that have an origin at <m>fa_i</m> and destination <m>ha_i</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously defining <m>g</m> in this way will potentially leave the possibility of arrows having duplicates,
              but the property <m>(fa_1 = fa_2) \Rightarrow (ha_1 = ha_2)</m> ensures that if any two arrows share the same
              origin they must share the same destination.  
            </p>
            <p>
              From a meta-perspective, it makes sense that the converse holds true for use to this practically as a definition. When
              we say "<m>h</m> is determined by <m>f</m>", we want it to be true if and only if it satisfies the properties
              we've defined it to have.
            </p>
          </solution>

        <example>
          <title>Exercise 2</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Show that... there is at least one <m>b</m> in <m>B</m> for which <m>h(a) = g(b)</m>...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I think the key idea in part (a) here is that the point <m>f(a)</m> precisely satisfies the properties
              we want for establishing the existence of <m>b</m>.  As long as there is some map <m>f</m> with 
              <m>g \circ f = h</m> then we can define <m>b = f(a)</m> and it follows directly that 
              <m>h(a) = (g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b)</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proving the converse in (b) seems a little trickier.  I think I'd want to approach this like 
              I did with "Exercise 1" and consider making an image by applying <m>g</m> to each element 
              <m>b_1,b_2,... \in \mathbf{1} \longrightarrow B</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we already know that for each <m>gb_i</m> there is at least one <m>a_i</m> such that
              <m>ha_i = gb_i</m>, we can begin to construct a map <m>f</m> by creating a collection of
              arrows with origin <m>a_i</m> and destination <m>b_i</m>.

        Upon finishing the exercises, I've chosen to not to retract my sarcastic pun above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, yeah, that's partly because I'm lazy, but I think it's also a good metaphor for what 
        I learned about this week.  Writing these posts is a multi-stage process that resembles a
        sequence of map compositions.  I read (at least some of) the section, work out the exercises, 
        then come back and revise.  What you see at the end is the composition, but not necessarily
        each step along the way. At the same time, some qualities of the end product itself may 
        restrict the process leading to it but others leave flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week's reading seemed to be about exactly how flexible these maps could be before they
        start to lose information.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I could have removed the remark at the start of this and replaced it with something else. Yet, 
        the fact that I'm now discussing it means it <em>must</em> be there.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems exceptionally well fitting to how my proofs this week worked.  I'm essentially arguing
        that these maps exists because I can describe a set of rules to construct them. Whether you believe
        me or not, well, that's another story...

        <title>Session 6: Two general aspects or uses of maps</title>
        <p>
          This week's reading didn't have any official exercises in it, but it also seemed important so I 
          wanted to make sure I gave it the same level of attention as the others.  I find that I need to
          continually reminding myself that math is not a race and that I should take advantage of current
          <em>privilege</em> to truly take things slow here.  My purpose isn't to get through the excercises
          in this book; it's to understand the deeper ideas behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This session is filled with beautiful mathematical writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I think math courses need more content like this.  At the same time, both the student and teacher
          in me recognize that this is one of the first things that would be cut from the syllabus if the 
          class ran short on time.  It makes me sad that our system's focus on measurable learning 
          objectives means that philosophical discussions are treated as dispensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In much the same way as the authors describe science as maps being used to understand reality, the
          education system uses assessments to understand what's going on inside a student's head.  Since
          we can't observe someone's state of mind, we alter their environment stimuli and see how they
          respond.  This presents problems when we're using map composition to turn one of many complex
          mental models down to a multiple choice question for the exam.  As long as a student could 
          distinguish between "sort" and "partition" by the end of this unit, we don't really care how it
          impacted their broader understanding of world around them.
        </p>

          I think there's a hidden exercise in this session.  I'll mark it as an example here so you can

            What struck me as interesting about this map was how closely it described
            <em>a book</em>.  There's only a finite number of "words" in the "language" 
            that the book is written using, and we can index them with positive integers
            describing their sequence in the book. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This observation struck me as interesting because my reading of this book 
            works the same as the sampling process.  You could generate a map from time
            to the index of the word that I'm reading at the time, and compose this map
            with the book map to find out what word I'm reading.  This would reveal my
            non-linear path through the book, rereading sections as needed to answer the
            problems I'm working on.
          </p>

            It makes me wonder if this session is actually an exercise in <em>meta-mathematics</em>.
            Maybe the reason the authors intended to sow seeds of curiousity about their ommission
            and for me look at the book as a system that can be studied using category theory itself. 
            The chapters of the book act as a <em>sort</em> for the exercises, but the fact that this
            chapter doesn't exercises have any means it's not a <em>partition</em>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it's kind of funny that this section of the book about sections would be a counter-example
            to the book's exercises having a section.

          It turns out that last week's lack of exercises wasn't as much of an anomaly as I thought it was.
          After realizing that this week's session didn't have any exercises either, I scanned ahead and 
          noticed that there are several sessions like this before eventually reaching a "Quiz" and "Test".
          I'm not sure how I plan to handle those yet, but I think I'm going to keep with my chill pace for
          now.  This session did include several side questions throughout that I can treat as I would the
          exercises.

                  I used the cursor to identify the following coordinates in pixels:

                  Next I calculated the distances from <m>r</m> to <m>q</m> and from <m>p</m> to <m>x</m>.
                  Specifically, <m>||q-r|| \approx 1557.4</m> and <m>||p-x|| \approx 319.19</m>.

                  With this information in hand, I can set up a ratio to determine <m>x</m>. 
                  Solving <m>\frac{3.5-(-4.3)}{0-x} \approx -\frac{1557.4}{319.19}</m> results in 
                  a solution of <m>x \approx -1.5</m>.

              What are the choice of origin, positive direction, and unit of 'distance' involved in
              specifying this isomorphism?...

          <solution>
            <p>
              Oooh this is a fun one! Let's presume we meet some alien species and are trying to sync up
              our timelines.  We're going to need both space and time coordinates if we really want to do
              this right.  One possibility is for both parties to use "the big bang" as a point of origin
              and "the light cone" for a direction and magnitude.  This choice makes converting easy, but
              potentially imprecise because of the sheer size of those values. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A much more practical approach would be to use the meeting time and location as a point of
              origin, use physical constants to communicate SI units, then work backwards to calculate the
              local time for each party using a Lorentz transformation.  We'd just need to where they came 
              from and how fast they traveled to convert their home civilization's time to their current 
              time. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I think the point that the authors were trying to communicate was that our choice of units 
              and magnitude for "time" are very specific to our origin on planet Earth.  If we're talking 
              about units of "years" as being "one orbit around the Sun" and the origin as a socially defined
              "common era", then an alien race from another plant would likely have totally different system
              of dating then us.  However, most SI units are based on physical properties of our universe.
              Even if this species chose a different set of base units than us, we could match up measurements
              of certain elements to develop an <em>isomorphism</em> between our two systems.

            In other words, the best player is alway paired with the worst player, the next best with the next 
            worst, and so on until all pairs have been assigned.  However, the fun doesn't stop there.

            The bracket also appears to balance "skill gap" between the top half and the bottom half.  The 
            winner of the match-up with the highest rank differential goes on to face the winner of the match
            with the lowest differential in the next round.  Those differentials sum to a constant much like 
            the ranks did.

              To make the 16 player bracket, I'm going to start by pairing off players based on rank:
              The player in rank 1 should be paired with the player in rank 16, rank 2 with rank 15, 
              rank 3 with rank 14, and so on until all 8 pairs have been assigned.  Since these pairings
              go from largest score differential to smallest, we can assign the pairs to each of the "ranks" 
              in the 8 player bracket to extend it further.

              This works out nicely because if the top 8 players all win their match-ups in
              the first round of the 16-player bracket, they'd wind up in a bracket that is 
              basically identical to their placement in the 8-player bracket. Likewise, if 
              the top four players continue to win then we end up in a situation identical to
              the 4-player bracket. It has a nice recursively defined structure.

          Rather than having exercises of its own, this session was focused on solving the exercises
          from Article II.  Since I'd already worked out these problems, all that remains for this week
          is to proofread.

              My diagram of all 6 sections from earlier matchs up with this incomplete diagram perfectly:

            <xref ref="fig-article2-ex5-3"/>
            <p>
              Likewise, I correctly arrived at a count of 8 retractions and drew those too:

            <p>
              If there's something to be critical about myself here, it would be that I was
              perhaps a little lax in assuming the domains and codomains of my maps were the same. 
              I jumped right into diagrams of <m>g</m> without specifying what it was.  In my defense, 
              this information was implicit in the diagrams themselves but the authors took an extra
              effort to explicitly articulate the qualities they were checking for in the map.

              I must admit, it took me several attempts to verify that my solution was equivalent to
              the book's with direct substitutions.  I had used <m>\set{f_1, s_1, f_2, s_2}</m> instead
              of the respective <m>\set{k, s', p, s}</m>.

            <p>
              I think I actually prefer my notation here over the authors because it makes the connection 
              between the functions and sections more clear.  I kept forgetting whether <m>s</m> or <m>s'</m>
              matched up with <m>p</m> or <m>k</m>.  Using the <m>\set{f_1,f_2}</m> notation makes the reversed
              composition ordering of the sections more readily apparent.

          Based on what I saw in this session, I think I was on the right track with my solutions to the 
          exercises from Article II.  It's nice to have this little checkpoint to validate my earlier work. 
          I'm usually the type that likes to try to solve the exercises in my head just to see if I can, but
          then I miss out on moments for reflection like this.

          The reading this week was interesting in how it approached the relationship between 
          "size of sets" and "properties of maps". <em>The art of counting without counting</em>
          seemed to be a recurring theme.
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 1:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              ...unless the set <m>A</m> has a point and <m>B</m> has none...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              So <m>A \mathrel{\vcenter{\huge \triangleleft} \!\!\!\! \vcenter{\tiny \rightarrow}} B</m>
              means that there exists some map <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m>. In the category of sets, we know
              that the number of possible maps from <m>A \longrightarrow B</m> is related to the size of the
              sets by a formula we arrived at in Session 2: <m>{|B|}^{|A|}</m>.  The only time when this expression
              for number of maps evaluates to 0 is when <m>|B| = 0</m> and <m>|A| > 0</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way of looking at this might to consider the contrapositive of this statement.  If we know that
              there does not exist a map from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, that means there must be some origin point in <m>A</m> for the 
              map to act on but no destination point in <m>B</m> to send it to.  Not having a place to send the point to 
              directly implies <m>B=\emptyset</m>.  If we also had <m>A =\emptyset</m> then we'd have a "null map", so the non-existance
              of a map also implies <m>A</m> must be non-empty.  
            </p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 2:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              ...Show that (R) ... [and] (T) ...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Let's start with the reflexive property (R): <m>A \leq_R A</m>.  This notation indicates that there
              exist maps <m>\set{s,r}</m> such that <m>A \xrightarrow{s} A \xrightarrow{r} A</m> with
              <m>rs = 1_A</m>. Clearly the map <m>1_A</m> already mets both these conditions since 
              <m>1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To prove the transitive property (T), we can construct a retraction for the composition of the 
              functions using a composition of their retractions.  If <m>A \leq_R B</m>, then there exist maps
              <m>\set{s_1,r_1}</m> such that <m>A \xrightarrow{s_1} B \xrightarrow{r_1} A</m> with
              <m>r_1 \circ s_1 = 1_A</m>.   Likewise, <m>B \leq_R C</m>, then there exist maps
              <m>\set{s_2,r_2}</m> such that <m>B \xrightarrow{s_2} C \xrightarrow{r_2} B</m> with
              <m>r_2 \circ s_2 = 1_B</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Given these <m>\set{s_1,r_1,s_2,r_2}</m>, we can define <m>A \xrightarrow{s_3} C = s_2 \circ s_1</m>
              and define <m>C \xrightarrow{r_3} A = r_1 \circ r_2</m>.  Note that <m>r_3 \circ s_3</m> can be
              evaluated as follows using the associative property:
            </p>
            <me>r_3 \circ s_3 = (r_1 \circ r_2) \circ (s_2 \circ s_1)</me>
            <me>= r_1 \circ (r_2 \circ s_2) \circ s_1</me>
            <me>= r_1 \circ 1_B \circ s_1 = r_1 \circ s_1 = 1_A</me>
            <p>
              This completes the proof that <m>A \leq_R C</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <example>
          <title>Exercise 3:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              ... Use these maps to construct an isomorphism <m>A \xrightarrow{f} A'</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              So we're given that both <m>A \mathrel{\substack{s \\[-0.6ex]
                \textstyle\longrightarrow \\[-0.6ex]
                \textstyle\longleftarrow \\[-0.6ex]
                 r}} B</m> and <m>A' \mathrel{\substack{ s' \\[-0.6ex]
                  \textstyle\longrightarrow \\[-0.6ex]
                  \textstyle\longleftarrow \\[-0.6ex]
                   r'}} B</m> "split the same idempotent" <m>B \xrightarrow{e} B</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The definition of "splitting an idempotent" tells us that <m>sr = e = s'r'</m>
              with <m>rs = 1_A</m> and <m>r's' = 1_{A'}</m>. Given these maps, we're trying to 
              establish a composition that goes from <m>A</m> to <m>A'</m> using <m>B</m> as a step
              in between.  To get from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> we can use map <m>s</m>, and then to
              get from <m>B</m> to <m>A'</m> we can use map <m>s'</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us define <m>A \xrightarrow{f} A'</m> by <m>r' \circ s</m>.  This map should be a 
              well-defined isomorphism with the inverse map given by <m>f^{-1} = r \circ s'</m>.
              To prove this, we must show that <m>f^{-1} \circ f = 1_A</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = 1_{A'}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the associative property, the first expression can be simplified as follows:
            </p>
           <me>f^{-1} \circ f = (r \circ s') \circ (r' \circ s) </me>
           <me> = r \circ (s' \circ r') \circ s  </me>
           <me> = r \circ e \circ s  </me>
           <me> = r \circ (s \circ r) \circ s</me>
           <me> = (r \circ s) \circ (r \circ s)</me>
           <me> = 1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A</me>
           <p>
            Likewise, the second expression can be similarly simplified:
          </p>  
          <me>f \circ f^{-1} = (r' \circ s) \circ (r \circ s') </me>
          <me> = r' \circ (s \circ r) \circ s'  </me>
          <me> = r' \circ e \circ s'  </me>
          <me> = r' \circ (s' \circ r') \circ s'</me>
          <me> = (r' \circ s') \circ (r' \circ s')</me>
          <me> = 1_{A'} \circ 1_{A'} = 1_{A'}</me>
          <p>
            These two conditions are sufficient to demonstrate that <m>f</m> is an isomorphism.
          </p>

        <title>Quiz</title>
        <p>
          Since the following section is entitled "How to solve the quiz problems", I'm interpreting
          that as a sign that answering these problems publicly like this is acceptable use.  My time
          as a teacher has taught me that the primary distinction betweeen formatitve and summative
          assessments lies in how you use them, and this quiz seems to be treated like the former.  The
          goal is to provide students with a self-check on important concepts before the first "test".
        </p>
        <p>
          As I'm still trying to force myself to slow down, my plan for time being is to take the
          quiz this week and self-grade my own work next week before attempting the "test" the week after.
          I feel as though posting test solutions online would be poor form, so I think I'm going to
          put my test solutions in a separate PretextBook that can be shared on a per person basis to
          anyone that's willing to help determine the correctness of my work.  We'll see how that goes in
          the future, but for now we focus on the problems at hand.

            <p>
              I know this may be a little regressive of me, but I found it easier to think of this problems
              in terms of "onto" and "one-to-one".  Since I'm looking for a map that "has a section but not
              a retraction", that effectively means the map is "one-to-one but not onto".  My insticts about
              functions tell me that this occurs when my "output space" is bigger than my "input space".

              Proving this is a retraction requires that we show <m>r \circ f = 1_A</m>.  Fortunately
              this proof is trivial since there's only one element in <m>A</m> for us to test. Since
              <m>a</m> is the only possible input, the fact that <m>(r \circ f)(a) = r(f(a)) = r(b) = a</m>
              is sufficient to satisfy the condition <m>r \circ f = 1_A</m>.  Thus, <m>r</m> is a
              retraction of <m>f</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this map <m>r</m> does not function as a section because <m>(f \circ r) \neq 1_B</m>.
              This can be easily observed by applying the composition <m>f \circ r</m> to point <m>c</m>:
              <m>(f \circ r)(c) = f(r(c)) = f(a) = b \neq c</m>.  In order for a map to be a section of <m>f</m>,
              it needs to send point <m>c</m> to something other than <m>b</m>, but there isn't anywhere else for
              it to go!

              Since we lose an element when mapping from <m>B \longrightarrow A</m>, there's no way to

              Recall that a map <m>e</m> is "idempotent" if <m>e \circ e = e</m>. Thus, we'll take the maps
              defined in (a) and (b) and see how they might be simplified after being applied twice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start with (a): <m>p \circ q</m>.  Composing this map with itself gives us
              <m>(p \circ q) \circ (p \circ q)</m>, which can be simplified using the associative property:
            </p>
            <me>(p \circ q) \circ (p \circ q) = p \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
            <me> = (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q</me>
            <me> = p \circ q</me>
            <p>
              Having demonstrated that <m>(p \circ q) \circ (p \circ q) = (p \circ q)</m>, we can safely
              conlude that the map in part (a) is idempotent.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can apply the same strategy in (b) with the expression <m>q \circ p</m>:
            </p>
            <me>(q \circ p) \circ (q \circ p) = q \circ p \circ q \circ p</me>
            <me>= q \circ (p \circ q \circ p)</me>
            <me> = q \circ p</me>
            <p>
              Since <m>(q \circ p) \circ (q \circ p) = q \circ p</m>, we can conclude that the map in (b)
              is idempotent as well.

              My gut instict tells me <m>q' = q \circ p \circ q</m> because that's the simpliest map I can
              construct that will have the requisite domain and codomain. Let's check to see if it has the
              desired properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we'll look at (a) by seeing if <m>p \circ q' \circ p = p</m>.  Using only the associative
              property, we can simplify the left hand side as follows:
            </p>
            <me>p \circ q' \circ p = p \circ (q \circ p \circ q) \circ p</me>
            <me>= p \circ q \circ p \circ q \circ p</me>
            <me>= (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q \circ p</me>
            <me>= p \circ q \circ p = p</me>
            <p>
              That confirms property (a).  We can use a similar method to demonstrate property (b):
              <m>q' \circ p \circ q' = q'</m>.
            </p>
            <me>q' \circ p \circ q' = (q \circ p \circ q) \circ p \circ (q \circ p \circ q)</me>
            <me> = q \circ p \circ q \circ p \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
            <me> = q \circ (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
            <me> = q \circ p \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
            <me> = q \circ (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q</me>
            <me> = q \circ p \circ q = q'</me>
            <p>
              Thus, our choice of <m>q'</m> has both of the required properties.

              Upon reading this problem, it sounded very similar to one of the situations in the "zoo"
              from Session 4.  Specifically, I was thinking of the map in Exercise 3 Item (c) where
              <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> is given by <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
              On closer inspection, my notes from that section indicate that this <m>f</m> had
              a section but no retraction -- which is the reverse of what I'm looking for here. I played
              around with item (a) from the zoo for a bit, but I wasn't quite happy with how the
              domains and codomains weren't aligning.  This got me thinking about a clue at the end of
              Session 9.  Specifically, the authors mention "Georg Cantor" by name.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the realization that I could use infinite sets of varying sizes, I decided that I could
              combine this notion with the ideas behind the set sizes in Problem 1 by making a map from a
              "countably infinite set" to an "uncountably infinite set".  In this situation, I could theoretically
              use Cantor's diagonalization argument to prove the non-existance of my section.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to use a "binary representation" map <m>\mathbb{Z}^+ \xrightarrow{f} (0,1)</m> that
              takes each positive integer and turns it into a binary representation of a real number
              between 0 and 1 by prepending "0." to the reversed binary representation of the integer.  Like so:

            We can construct a map <m>(0,1) \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb{Z}^+</m> that iterates along the digits of
            the input and sums up the product of that digit with the respective powers of 2.  For example,
            <m>g(0.01001)</m> could be evaluated as follows:
          </p>
          <me>g(0.01001) = 0 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^1 +  0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^4</me>
          <me>= 2^1 + 2^4 + 2^6 = 2 + 16 + 64 = 82</me>
          <p>
            Assuming we started with some positive integer and applied <m>f</m> to it, it would be in the
            table above and this map <m>g</m> will return the number we started with.  Thus we have a well
            defined retraction becaues <m>g \circ f = 1_{\mathbb{Z}^+}</m>.  However, Cantor's diagonal argument
            suggest that there still exists at least one real number in the interval (0,1) for which there is no
            inverse.  Consider the real number constructed by taking a single "bit" from each line of the table
            following the diagonal and flipping it while adding trailing zeroes to the right as needed:

            By concatenating all these flipped bits together we can constuct a number <m>y \in (0,1)</m> given by the
            binary expansion "0.0011..." as defined above. This number doesn't have a corresponding <m>x</m> value in
            the table for <m>f</m> because it differs from every output by at least one bit.  Since <m>g(y)</m> is
            undefined, we have <m>f \circ g \neq 1_{(0,1)}</m>.  The uniqueness of the inverses we proved in Article 2
            implies that the section couldn't be anything other than the retraction <m>g</m>, so we must conlude that
            <m>f</m> does not have section.

              would be "the father of my paternal grandmother" which is clearly a different person
              than "my father" <m>f(me)</m> so <m>f \circ g \circ f \neq f</m>.  Likewise, the
              map <m>f \circ g</m> would be like a relation of "maternal grandfather".  Clearly
              the "maternal grandfather of my maternal grandfather" described by <m>f \circ g \circ f \circ g(me)</m>
              would be a different person than "my maternal grandfather" <m>f \circ g(me)</m>.

          This week I worked through Test 1, and honestly, it wasn't half as hard as I remembered it being the first time

              coming up with a endomap <m>e</m> that satisfied <m>e \circ e = e</m>, I seem to have constructed one 
              where <m>e \circ e = 1_A</m>.  As a result of using an <em>involution</em> instead, I was justifiably 
              having a hard time showing the properties in part (c).  This defintion actually appears on the page
              adjacent to the test with a note to "see Article III", so I'd expect that this was a common mistake made

          This reminds me of my undergraduate research study where I had my first crash course in topology.
          In fact, flipping back to the start of book reveals the following warning: "Exceptionally, Session 10 is

          As I was reading this week, I also felt reminded of Problem 1* from the Quiz.  This idea that we can 
          compare the size of infinite sets like <m>\mathbb{R}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> using the language of
          retractions seems analagous to the formalation of Brouwer's theorems.  I'm expecting the proofs in this
          section to follow a similar format, even though this notion of a "continuous maps" seems a little informal
          at the moment.

                 g}} D</m> and that <m>g \circ j = j</m>.  We want to show that there's some point
                 <m>x \in D</m> such that <m>f(x) = g(x)</m> We're also told to use the <em>retraction

                  a retraction for j".

              one of them as the "tail" and one as the "head".  We can define a map <m>r: D \longrightarrow C</m>
              that follows this arrow until it reaches the boundary point on the circle like so:

              Since we're guaranteed to have <m>r(x) \in C</m>, let's see what happens when we compose
              <m>j</m> with it. If we could prove <m>r \circ j = 1_C</m>, we'd have a 
              contradiction and be done, but it's not clear that's the case quite yet. I think the 
              key to this lies in the fact that <m>g \circ j = j</m>.  In the text, they proved the
              special case where <m>g = 1_D</m>.  This is a slightly more relaxation condition 
              to show that <m>g</m> doesn't need to be the identity everywhere <mdash/> it just needs
              to be the identity on the edge of the disk where it meets the circle. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm thinking of like taking a sample <m>b</m> from the embedding of <m>C</m> rather than
              from <m>D</m> at large.  The text used the notation <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{b} C</m> to show this
              operation. Once we've chosen that <m>b</m>, we can apply the map <m>j</m> to aquire our point
              <m>x</m> on the edge of the disk. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>C \subset D</m>, the rule that <m>f(x) \neq g(x)</m> still applies, but if we force 
              <m>g</m> to be the "head" of the arrow then we'll have an arrow whose "head" lies on the boundary,
              which also happens to be the same point we originated from.

              Being able to follow the points back to their origins like this 
              essentially gives us a retraction for <m>j</m>.  However, we already
              know such retraction can't exist! This means that our assumption that
              <m>\forall x \in D: f(x) \neq g(x)</m> is false, which is logically
              equivalent to the assertion that <m>\exists x \in D: f(x) = g(x)</m>.  QED.

              I must admint, this all feels a little "hand wavy" still.  I'm not really sure how
              much of Euclidean geometry I'm projecting onto the situation.  I think this
              is also a good spot to point out the "antipodal" map that we'd get by swapping
              the head and tail of our arrow between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>:

                I'd expect this map to have some fun properties. The one situation
                where we'd have an endomap on the circle with no fixed points is the
                one that maps each point to the one opposite it, but this needs a fixed
                point for us to reflect over.  I think this is going to be important later.

              Let's sort through our givens here.  We know we have <m>A \mathrel{\substack{s \\[-0.6ex]
                \textstyle\longrightarrow \\[-0.6ex]

                 r}} X</m> with <m>r \circ s = 1_A</m>.  We also know that <m>X</m> has a fixed point 
                 property: for every endomap <m>X \xrightarrow{f} X</m> there exists some <m>T \xrightarrow{x} X</m>
                 with <m>f x = x</m>.  We want to show that <m>A</m> has the same property for maps from <m>T</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start by having a look at the class of endomaps <m>A \xrightarrow{g} A</m>. Each map <m>g</m> 
              must have some corresponding map <m>f</m> given by <m>f = s \circ g \circ r</m>.  We can apply <m>r</m>
              on the left and <m>s</m> on the right to get an equivalent expresson for <m>g</m> in terms of <m>f</m>:
            </p>
            <me>f = s \circ g \circ r</me>
            <me>\implies r \circ f \circ s = r \circ s \circ g \circ r \circ s</me>
            <me>\implies r \circ f \circ s = 1_A \circ g \circ 1_A</me>
            <me>\implies r \circ f \circ s = g</me>
            <p>
              Since this map  <m>f</m> has some fixed point <m>x</m> such that <m>f x = x</m>,
              there must be some corresponding point in <m>A</m> given by <m>y = s x</m> that has 
              this property for <m>g</m>. It should then follow that <m>y = s x</m> is a fixed point of <m>g</m>
              satisfying.   
            </p>
            <me>g (y) = g \circ s (x)</me>
            <me> = (s \circ f \circ r) \circ s (x)</me>
            <me> = s \circ f \circ r \circ s (x)</me>
            <me> = s \circ f \circ (r \circ s) (x)</me>
            <me> = s \circ f \circ 1_A (x)</me>
            <me> = s \circ f (x)</me>
            <me> = s \circ x = y</me>
            <p>
              Having proven that <m>g y = y</m>, we've established our fixed point property and I think we're done.

            <p>
              Let's recap the last exercise:  Given "A is a retract of X" (<m>\exists A \mathrel{\substack{s \\[-0.6ex]
                \textstyle\longrightarrow \\[-0.6ex]
                \textstyle\longleftarrow \\[-0.6ex]
                 r}} X \text{such that} r \circ s = 1_A</m>) and "X has the fixed point property for maps from T" (
                  <m>\forall X \xrightarrow{f} X: \exists T \xrightarrow{x} X</m> such that <m>f(x) = x</m>),
              it follows that "A also has the fixed point property" (
                <m>\forall A \xrightarrow{g} A: \exists T \xrightarrow{y} A</m> such that<m>g(y) = y</m>).
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of theorem (1), we can assume the premise "Let <m>I</m> be a line segment including its endpoints
              (<m>I</m> for Interval) and suppose <m>f: I \longrightarrow I</m> is a continuous endomap.  Then <m>f</m> must 
              have a fixed point: a point <m>x</m> in <m>I</m> for which <m>f(x) = x</m>." 
            </p>
            <p>
              We're attempting to show that this is sufficient to imply the corresponding retraction theorem:
              "Consider the inclusion map <m>j: E \longrightarrow I</m> of the two-point set <m>E</m> as 
              boundary of the interval <m>I</m>.  There is no continuous map which is a retraction for j."
            </p>

            <p>
              Since <m>E</m> is a two-point set, perhaps we can use the fact that there are only four possible 
              endomaps that can exist in that space. These are illustrated below:

              <p>
                Of these four maps, precisely one has the property of "having no fixed point".  This <em>antipodal</em>
                map sends each of the points in <m>E</m> to the "opposite" point.  For the sake of convenience, let's
                can name these points <m>E = {0, 1}</m>.  The antipodal map <m>E \xrightarrow{a} E</m> is equivalent
                to the operation <m>a(x) = 1 - x</m>, with the other maps being given by <m>1_A</m>, 
                <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \{0\}</m>, <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \{1\}</m>. This is the unique endomap 
                on <m>A</m> satisfying <m>a \circ a = 1_A</m>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm thinking the easiest way to approach this is to assume we have some map <m>I \xrightarrow{f} I</m>
                that acts like our "antipodal" map sending each point to it's mirror on the other half of the interval.    
                For us to have any notion of continuity on this interval, we'd need to be able to take an arbitrarily small
                step to one side of each endpoint so we should be able to take the opposite step from the other.  In other
                words, for any <m>\epsilon > 0</m>, we can pair <m>0+\epsilon</m> with <m>1-\epsilon</m>. Using the interval 
                <m>[0,1]</m> and <m>a(x) = 1 - x</m> as this operation, it's easy to see that <m>a</m> produces a fixed point
                in the middle at <m>x=0.5</m> where it's equidistantant from the endpoints <m>\{0,1\}</m>. 
              </p>

              <p>
                If any map on this interval was going to "have no fixed point", it would have needed to be an antipodal map. 
                In order for any map <m>r: I \longrightarrow E</m> to possibly satisfy <m>r \circ j = 1_E</m>, it needs to
                divide the points into two sections. Our map either needs to map "0.5" to itself or to leave it undefined
                altogther. If we have arrows going from 0 to 1 and arrows from 1 to 0, at some point along the way the "heads"
                of our arrows need to go past the "tails" coming from the opposite direction. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps this makes more sense if I step back a bit and state something "obvious": <em>There is no retraction
                from <m>E</m> to <m>\mathbf{1}</m>.</em> <m>E</m> has two points while <m>\mathbf{1}</m> has one.  <m>E</m> 
                <em>might</em> have a section, in which case we have one of the two bottom diagrams in the possible endomaps
                figure above.  This would be our map that takes the fixed point and sends it to itself. We can go from <m>1 
                \longrightarrow E \longrightarrow 1</m>, but we make <m>1_E</m> by going from <m>E \longrightarrow 1 
                \longrightarrow E</m> because there simply aren't enough points to work with.
               </p>
               <p>
                It sounds like a variation of the intermediate value theorem. If there's a path of arrows leading from 0 to 1,
                then we should be able to reverse it and follow the arrows from 1 to 0.  When we do, either there needs to be some
                fixed point that connects the heads from one path to the tails from the other or we don't have a continuous path 
                <mdash/>we jump!

                  If it sounds like I'm unsure at this point, that's because I am. Maybe attempting the 
                  second theorem will provide more insight.
               </p>
               <p>
                  For (2) we're given that any continuous endomap on the closed disk, <m>D</m> must 
                  have a fixed point.  We want to prove that there is no continuous map which is 
                  a retraction for the inclusion map <m>j : C \longrightarrow D</m> of the circle into 
                  the disk.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I think we can develop a similar definition of an "antipodal map" on the circle by
                  reflecting across the center of the disk.  This map <m>C \xrightarrow{a} C</m> is 
                  a unique endomap on <m>C</m>. It has no fixed points for the circle <mdash/> <m>\forall x 
                  \in C: a(x) \neq x</m> <mdash/>  and acts as it's own inverse <mdash/>  <m>a \circ a = 1_C</m>.  We can
                  extend this map to the disk, but it fails to provide an inverse for the point at the 
                  center which we reflected over.  Our antipodal map is the only possible section of the 
                  disk's boundary, but it fails to be a retraction due to this "missing" point in the middle.
               </p>
               <p>
                  A similar line of reasoning should hold true for the sphere.  The antipodal map reflects
                  each point on the sphere across the center to the opposite side.  It's the only possible 
                  section that doesn't fix any points on the sphere, but then any corresponding retraction on
                  the ball would be missing the center or have a fixed point there.
               </p>
               <p>
                  After all that, I'm still a little uncertain about this.  I'm not convinced my proof is
                  correct, but I also won't find out one way or the other unless I keep moving. So, on we go.

              Story time! I'm chilling in Buffalo on a Friday morning when I get a call from
              a friend and decide to take a road trip to Rochester to vist them. So at noon,
              I jump in the car and start heading there, but I remember I left my wallet! I bust
              a U and go back home to look for it.  By the time I find it, my tummy is growling.
              I head over my favorite taqueria for a bite.  It's a little out of my way, but the
              salsa is to die for.  I finally get on the road again, but now everyone is getting 
              out of work so I hit some nasty traffic on the way.  After crawling along a snail's
              pace for a few hours I'm starting to get tired and need to use the restroom.  I make
              a quick detour to a little cafe I just passed.  By the time I'm back on the road again,
              traffic has cleared up and it's a straight shot to Rochester at 5:00pm. My trip might look
              something like this:

              Okay, maybe I got carried away, but this is "my" story.  It has a beginning, in Buffalo
              at noon and it has an end, in Rochester at 5:00pm.  In the figure above, the horizontal
              axis is the time in hours since my departure, and the vertical axis in the distance in 
              miles along the road.  Note that in my story, I double back for tacos, which is why 
              there's a section in the map with negative distance.  "Your" story might be a little
              different, but what I do know is that you were "somewhere on the road between Buffalo 
              and Rochester" for the entire duration.  For now, let's suppose you just drive back a
              forth along some stretch of road in the middle like so:

              It should be obvious in this case that our paths have to cross, but we're
              trying to generalize these maps as much as possible.  For now, let's start 
              giving some of these objects proper names.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let <m>E_t = \{t_0,t_1\}</m> be our start time and end time for "endpoints" of 
              the trip in "time".  Let <m>E_p = \{p_0,p_1\}</m> be Buffalo and Rochester, our
              "endpoints" on the "road".  Since both time and space are continuous, these
              endpoints can be included in the respective intervals <m>I_t</m> and <m>I_p</m>.
              Let's call the inclusion map on the "time"-line to be <m>j_t : E_t \longrightarrow I_t</m>
              and the inclusion map on the "position"-line to be <m>j_p : E_p \longrightarrow I_p</m>. 
              Note that Brouwer's 1st Theorem says there can't exist any retractions for either of 
              these maps.
            </p>
            <p>
              My position at any given time is a map <m>m: I_t \longrightarrow I_p</m> that needs to
              satisfy certain conditions.  I know <m>m(t_0)=p_0</m> and <m>m(t_1)=p_1</m>: that at the start of my 
              trip I'm in Buffalo and at the end I'm in Rochester.  Note that since our endpoints are included:
              <m>m j_t = j_p</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The premise of this thought experiment is based around the idea that if "you" also have a map 
              <m>y: I_t \longrightarrow I_p</m> we must necessarily meet somewhere in that "space-time".  We're 
              using some kind of "freeway distance", where my 'location' sticks to the exit I took off it when 
              I needed to make a stop.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe "you" lived your entire life in Buffalo such that your <m>y t = p_0 \forall t \in I_t</m>,
              our meeting place would be at the start of of my trip or some time prior! In the other extreme, 
              maybe you've lived your entire life in Rochester and your <m>y t = p_1 \forall t \in I_t</m>. In this
              case, "you meeting me" is contigent on "me deciding to make the trip" and we "meet" at 5:00pm.  It's 
              also possible you've never been to either Buffalo nor Rochester but live some place along the way, or 
              maybe have been to one but not the other.  In any of these cases, we can can map your position to some
              sub-interval of <m>I_p</m> for the entire time period <m>I_t</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I'm going to argue is that if you have such a map and we <em>never meet</em> we can construct a
              continuous retraction from <m>r: I \longrightarrow E</m> with no fixed point.  Since Brouwer's theorem
              establishes that such a retraction can't exist, there must be some <m>\mathbf(1) \xrightarrow(x) I_t</m> 
              with the property <m>m x = y x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, let's rule out the "easy maps".  Suppose I hadn't doubled back at all and moved steadily from 
              Buffalo to Rochester so that my path is invertable <mdash/> I have a unique position for every time.
              We'd be able to use your map construct endomap on <m>I_t</m> through the composition given by 
              <m>I_t \xrightarrow{y} I_p \xrightarrow{m^{-1}} I_t</m>.  Our fixed point theorem says any continuous
              endomap has a fixed point, so there's some <m>x</m> with <m>(m^(-1) \circ y) x = x</m>.  Apply <m>m</m>
              on the left side to get <m>m \circ (m^(-1) \circ y) x = y x = m x</m>.   We meet at time <m>x</m> and
              position <m>y x = m x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if your map is invertable?  Well, then we could use it to construct an endomap on <m>I_p</m>.  
              We compose <m>I_p \xrightarrow{y^{-1}} I_t \xrightarrow{m} I_p</m>.  This implies there's some fixed
              point <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} I_p</m> with <m>(m \circ y^{-1}) x = x</m>.  Note that our spaces 
              are different, so here we meet at time <m>y^{-1} x</m> and position <m>x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is however, one map that might have the property <m>m x = y x \forall t \in I_t</m>.  Imagine
              my "evil twin".  This twin starts in the opposite city and takes the opposite that I do along the way.
              If <m>any</m> map is going to avoid coming into contact with me at every step in my journey, it would
              have to be him.  He takes every step I do, but in the opposite direction!  This is the composition of 
              my map with the "antipodal map" on <m>I_t</m><mdash/> it takes every moment in my journey in reverse. 
              If my map is continuous, so is my evil twin.  If there's a sequence of arrows, we can reverse them.  
            </p>
            <p>
              We've already established that my journey is not invertable, so it stands to reason that 
              my evil twin would also have that property. But check this out, even me and my evil twin
              need to meet!

                The composition of the antipodal map <m>a_t</m> on <m>I_t</m> followed my <m>m</m> must be 
                the same as <m>m</m> followed by the antipodal map <m>a_p</m> on <m>I_p</m>.  My trip needs
                to be reversable, but we've already shown that it can't be.  The fixed point theorem says 
                me and my evil twin have to either meet or jump over each other <mdash/> the map can't be 
                continuous without the meet-up!
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm thinking that we can use the meeting place of myself and my evil twin as an approximation
                for the midpoint of my journey.  Your map needs to have some evil twin midpoint also. If we 
                alternate "halfway points", we should be able to do something of a binary search to home in on 
                each other's location in terms of whether we're closer in the front or back half of our respective
                trips.  Essentially, we'd have an analogue for the <em>mean value theorem</em>.

                I think this is about as close as I'm going to get for "an answer" to (a) and (b) for the week. 
                I'm not really sure how I would generalize it further for (c) and (d).  I feel like right now 
                there's a glaring weak spot in my argument by even assuming <m>y: I_t \longrightarrow I_p</m>
                is well-defined for the entire space.  What if "you" were born or died sometime during my trip?  
                Would I still necessarily "meet" you?
              </p>
              <p>
                The thing that I'm left curious is about the connection between Brouwer's theorems and my notions about 
                simplices. I'm used to this idea of going from a point <m>S_0</m>, to a line segment <m>S_1</m>, to a triangle
                <m>S_2</m>, to a tetrahedra <m>S_3</m>, and then generalizing to higher dimensional spaces <m>S_n</m>
                from there.  There seems like an obvious parallel to Brouwer's first theorem that says we can't have a 
                retraction from <m>S_1</m> to <m>S_0</m>, or from any <m>S_n</m> to <m>S_m</m> with <m>m \leq n</m> for that
                matter.

          Having "attempted" all of the exercises in the session, I think I'll stop here.  I feel like I could easily spend
          another week on this session, but since the authors explicitly state it's not important I'll take them for
          their word.  They obviously have spent a lot more time on it than I have.  I didn't even have time to proofread

            <p>
              Show that if both <m>f</m> as above and also...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Our basic idea here is that <m>f</m> "respects the structure" of our category
              <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>.  That is:
            </p>
            <me>\boxed{X^{\circlearrowright \alpha}} \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \boxed{Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}}</me>
            <p>
              Satisifies <m>\boxed{f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f}</m> for all endomaps <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>.                
            </p>
            <p>
              Now suppose we have another map <m>g</m> with
            </p>
            <me>\boxed{Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}} \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} \boxed{Z^{\circlearrowright \gamma}}</me>
            <me>\boxed{g \circ \beta = \gamma \circ g}</me> 
            <p> 
              We can then compose these maps to produce a composition <m>g \circ f</m>:
            </p>
            <me>\boxed{X^{\circlearrowright \alpha}} \overset{g \circ f}{\longrightarrow} \boxed{Z^{\circlearrowright \gamma}}</me>
            <p>
              This map should preserve structure also if we can prove that <m>(g \circ f) \circ \alpha = \gamma (g \circ f)</m>.  
              This should be fairly straight forward to show using the associative property and our previous assumptions:
            </p>
            <me>(g \circ f) \circ \alpha = g \circ f \circ \alpha</me>
            <me> = g \circ (f \circ \alpha) = g \circ (\beta \circ f)</me>
            <me> = (g \circ \beta) \circ f = (\gamma \circ g) \circ f</me>
            <me> = \gamma \circ (g \circ f)</me>
            <p>
              And that completes the exercise.
            </p>

          <title>Exercise 2:</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              What can you prove...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Recall that an endomap <m>e: A \longrightarrow A</m> is "idempotent" if 
              <m>e \circ e = e</m>. If <m>r</m> is a "retraction" for <m>e</m>, that 
              implies <m>r \circ e = 1_A</m>.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch what happens when if we apply <m>e</m> on the right of both sides
              to <m>r \circ e = 1_A</m>:  
            </p>
            <me>r \circ e \circ e = 1_A \circ e</me>
            <me>\implies r \circ e = e</me>
            <me>\implies 1_A = e</me>
            <p>
              Essentially, a retraction preserves the fixed point proprerty.  Since
              <m>e</m> fixes every point it touches and this retraction can restore
              each value afterwards, that can only happen if <m>e = 1_A</m>.
            </p>

          <statement>
            <p>
              A finite set <m>A</m> has an even number of elements iff...
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              I'm not really sure what the question is, so I'm assuming this is a
              "prove it" problem.  I think this is essentially the approach I tried to 
              take with Brouwer's theorems lasts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If we define as set <m>A</m> being "even" iff there is an involution with no
              fixed points.  This is like the "antipodal map" I explored earlier that pairs 
              up each point in a space with it's "opposite".  When we're working with an
              antipodal map on the interval, we either we have a point in the middle that 
              maps to itself or we "jump" over it.  The fixed point property becomes a proxy
              for whether or not the map is continuous because we forced the interval to be "odd".
              The only problem with using this idea here is that the interval had a natural order to
              it while the set <m>A</m> may not, so our involution isn't necessarily unique.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe it might help to think of taking a map <m>f</m> applying and taking an "image" 
              of it for every <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} A \xrightarrow{f} \text{Image}_f(A)</m>.  
              Either we find some point <m>f x = x</m> or we don't, but we can use this to classify 
              each point as "fixed" or "not".  Essentially this process defines map <m>g: A \longrightarrow\{0,1\}</m> 
              that returns <m>1</m> if a point is fixed by <m>f</m> or <m>0</m> if it doesn't.  However, since <m>f</m> is known 
              to be an involution with <m>f \circ f = 1_A</m> then there needs to be at least as many points in
              <m>\text{Image}_f(A)</m> as there are in <m>A</m> which ensures that <m>\text{Image}_f(A) = A</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Framing the problem like this allows us to ask if there exists a section of <m>A</m> which permits 
              a retraction on <m>g</m>.  More specifically, we're looking for a map <m>s: \{0,1\} \longrightarrow A</m>
              with <m>g \circ s = 1_{\{0,1\}}</m>. If <m>f = 1_A</m> then <m>\forall x \in A: g x = 1 </m>, and 
              consequently <m>s(0)</m> would be undefined.  If <m>f</m> has no fixed points then 
              <m>\forall x \in A: g x = 0</m>, and consequently <m>s(1)</m> would be undefined.  In order for
              this map <m>s</m> to exist, <m>f</m> must have at least one fixed point and one non-fixed
              point.  That is, for some <m>s(1) = x \in A</m> we have <m>f x = x </m> and some <m>s(0) = y \in A</m>
              such that <m>f y \neq y</m> with <m>g x = 1</m> and <m>g y = 0</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem with this is that such a map can't exist without <m>A</m> having at least three points: 
              <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>f y</m>.  It's impossible for a composition of the any form 
              <m>\{x,y,fy\} \longrightarrow \{0,1\} \longrightarrow \{x,y,fy\}</m> to ever produce an identity map.
              If a retraction for <m>g</m> existed it would need to be the same as the section, so clearly the 
              fixed point property on <m>f</m> means that no map is a retraction from <m>A</m> to <m>\{0,1\}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel like I'm starting to talk in circles now, so I'll just add that I think there's some parallels
              to be made with the "split idempotent" exercise from Session 9.  
            </p>
            <p>
              If all points in <m>f</m> are fixed, that implies a splitting of <m>f</m> by <m>\mathbf{1}</m>.
              If no points in <m>f</m> are fixed, that also implies a splitting of <m>f</m> by <m>\mathbf{1}</m>.
              If <m>f</m> has both fixed and non-fixed points, that implies a splitting of <m>f</m> by
              <m>\{0,1\}</m>.  Since there is no isomorphism between <m>\mathbf{1}</m> and <m>\{0,1\}</m>, we use 
              the result of Session 9 Exercise 3 to infer that <m>f</m> can't be split by both of them simultaneously.  If 
              our <m>f</m> has both fixed and non-fixed points, the set of fixed points would preserve an isomorphism
              with <m>\mathbf{1}</m> <mdash/> meaning that the point fixed by <m>f</m> would necessarily be unique.  
              Likewise, each non-fixed point <m>y</m> needs to exists as part of a pair with some <m>f y</m> to 
              preserve the isomorphism between <m>\{0,1\}</m> and <m>\{y,fy\}</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not sure if I'm using this concept of "splitting <m>f</m> by <m>\{0,1\}</m>" correctly here, 
              but it seems like it might be a reasonable analogy of "division by two" for generic maps.

              The previous page defines "automorphism" as an "endomap which is also an isomorphism",
              so I'm going to have to say "yes".  We can define the inverse by <m>\alpha^{-1}(x) = x - 3</m>.  
              It follows that <m>\alpha \circ \alpha^{-1}(x) = \alpha(x - 3) = (x - 3) + 3 = x</m> and
              <m>\alpha^{-1} \circ \alpha(x) = \alpha^{-1}(x + 3) = (x + 3) - 3 = x</m>, satisfying 
              the definition for an isomorphism.  This map is neither idempotent nor an involution,
              and has no fixed points.

              Conceptually, we can loosely define an inverse by <m>\alpha^{-1}(x) = \lfloor x/5 \rfloor</m>.  
              However, this will not meet the definition for an automorphism.  It mights the criteria 
              for a "section" since <m>\alpha^{-1}(x) \circ \alpha = \lfloor (5x)/5 \rfloor = x</m>, but it's not a 
              "retraction" since <m>\alpha \circ \alpha^{-1}(1) = 5 \lfloor x/5 \rfloor \neq x</m> for any <m>x</m>
              which is not a multiple of 5. This map is neither idempotent nor an involution, but does have fixed point
              at 0.

                Clearly the above diagram of <m>\alpha</m> is fully described by the relations
                <m>\alpha(x)=y</m>, <m>\alpha(y)=z</m>, and <m>\alpha(z)=y</m>.

              <p>
                In order to demonstrate that <m>\alpha^3=\alpha</m>, we just need to show it holds 
                for all three points: that <m>\alpha^3(x) = \alpha(x)</m>, <m>\alpha^3(y) = \alpha(y)</m>, 
                and <m>\alpha^3(z) = \alpha(z)</m>.  Let's verify these one at a time:
              </p>            
              <me>\alpha^3(x) = \alpha^2(y) = \alpha(z) = y = \alpha(x)</me>
              <me>\alpha^3(y) = \alpha^2(z) = \alpha(y) = z = \alpha(y)</me>
              <me>\alpha^3(z) = \alpha^2(y) = \alpha(z) = y = \alpha(z)</me>
              <p>
                Having established that <m>\alpha^3=\alpha</m> holds for all three values, let's next address
                idempotency by checking if <m>\alpha^2=\alpha</m>.  It's pretty clear that this fails for <m>x</m>.
                <m>\alpha^2(x) = \alpha(y) = z</m> but <m>\alpha(x) = y</m>, so <m>\alpha^2(x) \neq \alpha(x)</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, we need to check whether or not <m>\alpha</m> is an involution.  Since an involution
                would imply <m>\alpha \circ \alpha = 1_A</m>, the case of <m>\alpha^2(x) = z \neq x</m> serves
                as a counter-example to this expression.

          It's really interesting to the use of formalized abstraction here.  We looked at 
          some simple examples in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m> and now we're 
          embedding that in this broader category of directed graphs
           <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>
          in a way that preserves the properties we used.  It feels like we're "stepping out
          of the box" in a very deliberate fashion so what we can take what we know "outside"
          and apply it to solve problems "inside".

                While creating the diagram, there's some obvious structural patterns.
                In order to draw this, I started by placing the six points in 
                <m>P = \{k,m,n,p,q,r\}</m>.  The other objects are the arrows, namely
                <m>X = \{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>. Our maps <m>X \xrightarrow{s} P</m> and
                <m>X \xrightarrow{t} P</m> represent the source and target of 
                each arrow.  For me, it seemed natural to structure this information
                into a table:
              </p>      
              <table>
                <tabular>

                  <cell><m>1 \xrightarrow{x} X</m></cell>
                  <cell><m>s(x)</m></cell>

                </row>
                </tabular>
              </table>  
              <p>
                Based on this table, the questions become fairly straight forward.
                The input <m>b \in X</m> has the same output points for <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>,
                specifically <m>s(b) = t(b) = m</m>.  There is no element <m>x \in X</m> with
                <m>t(x) = k</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm thinking these sub-questions are important because they show that these arrow
                maps have neither "retraction" nor "sections". Unless we're very specific about
                the qualities of our maps, our source and target maps will likely be non-invertable. 
                I find arrows <m>a</m> and <m>c</m> particularly interesting because they are <em>two
                different arrows</em> with the same source <m>s(a) = s(c) = k</m> and same target
                <m>t(a) = t(c) = m</m>. I feel like I'm fighting a natural tendancy to assume that 
                "having the same source and target" makes them "the same arrow" but that equivalency
                may not necessarily hold true in a broader category.

                    <p>
                      In order to show that the composition preserves source and target relations,
                      we'd need to demonstrate that both <m>(g_D \circ f_D) s = s'' (g_A \circ f_A)</m>
                      and <m>(g_D \circ f_D) t = t'' (g_A \circ f_A)</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By the associative property, <m>(g_D \circ f_D) s = g_D \circ (f_D \circ s)</m>.
                      Using the substition <m>f_D \circ s = s' f_D</m> gives us <m>g_D \circ s' \circ f_A</m>,
                      and allows us to the perform a subsitution using <m>g_D \circ s' = s'' g_A</m> to 
                      show <m>g_D \circ s' \circ f_A = s'' \circ g_A \circ f_A</m>. 
                      It follows that <m>(g_D \circ f_D) s = s'' (g_A \circ f_A)</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We can apply a similar process on <m>(g_D \circ f_D) t</m>. The
                      associative property gives us <m>g_D \circ (f_D \circ t)</m>, which allows
                      us to use the substition <m>f_D \circ t = t' f_D</m> to get <m>g_D \circ t' \circ f_A</m>.
                      Next we use our property that <m>g_D \circ t' = t'' g_A</m> to perform another
                      subsitution resulting in <m>g_D \circ t' \circ f_A = t'' \circ g_A \circ f_A</m>. 
                      It follows that <m>(g_D \circ f_D) t = t'' (g_A \circ f_A)</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Having established the source and target preservation properties, we can
                      conclude that <m>g \circ f </m> is an well defined 
                      <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>-map:

              In order to preserve structure, the <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>-map
              is required to preserve the relations <m>f \circ 1_X = 1_Y \circ f</m> and 
              <m>f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f</m>.  The former is a trivial result of the

                  It's easy to see how the embedding illustrations above are composed together
                  together to produce an embedding of the compositions.  The identity
                  property ensures that
                  <m>g \circ f \circ 1_X = g \circ 1_Y \circ f = 1_Z \circ g \circ f</m>.
                  The structure inherited from the endomaps ensures that 
                  <m>g \circ f \circ \alpha = g \circ \beta \circ f = \gamma g \circ f</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Having shown that these properties are preserved, I think we've sufficiently 
                 demonstrated that <m>I(g \circ f) = I(g) \circ I(f)</m>.

              To be honest, I wasn't quite sure how to start this one at first so I just 
              started exploring small endomaps. I explored too many to review them all,
              but in the process I learned some things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think I had conceptually confused <m>f_D</m> and <m>f_A</m> at 
              first. I was under the impression that <m>f_A</m> "produced an arrow" 
              and <m>f_D</m> "produced a dot", but a closer reading of the book stated
              that <m>f_A</m> "operates on arrows" and <m>f_D</m> "operates on dots".  
              Eventually I made a mental shift to the Spanish <m>antes</m> (before) and
              <m>despues</m> (after) because it helped me remember the relationship with
              the endomaps.
            </p>
            <p>
             I found tables to be a nice way of organizing all the information about
             my "arrows" and "dots".  Having my information organized reminded me
             of Exercise 10.  Looking back over my notes, I had noticed earlier that
             the diagram included a pair of two different arrows with the same source
             and destination.  I took this as a hint.
            </p>
            <p>
              I  also found myself repeatedly going back to the map in Example 9 as
              a reference.  There was something about the way the endomap 
              removes an element that seemed like it might be important.  I 
              labeled the arrows in addition to the points to help keep track
              of what I was working with:

              I had a hunch that <m>\alpha^3=\alpha</m> might help establish
              that <m>f_D \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f_A</m>.  My idea revolved
              around the idea that if I could somehow make <m>f_D</m>, <m>f_A</m>,
              and <m>\beta</m> by composing <m>\alpha</m> with itself multiple times
              that I could set up a situation where they balance out.

              I think I also was confused about the inclusion <m>J</m> and 
              the property that the "source and target structures are the same
              map".  I wasn't sure if I needed to enforce this restriction on
              that all arrows in my endomaps were loops or not.  I started to
              wonder how much of this ambiguity was intentional, and if looser
              of a definition of "loop" might be in order.

                  of the same character.  I wondered how my mental model of Konshu might vary
                  depending on which version I encountered first.  To appease my "fussy professor",
                  I'm going to define my set <m>X</m> to be the set of "Konshu Models" 
                  <m>\{\text{Comic Konshu},\text{Myth Konshu},\text{My Konshu}\}</m> and endomap 
                  <m>\alpha</m> to be the "influences" acting on those models.

                  I reasoned that the <em>Moon Knight</em> from the comics used 
                  the mythology around Konshu to develop the character, but as
                  more people read the comic they start to project qualities from
                  the comic character back to the deity.  Whether those projections
                  align with the mythology will impact the design of later comics, 
                  forming a sort of feedback loop.  Prior to seeing the Netflix show,
                  my model of Konshu isn't really impacted by either <mdash/> I'm just
                  off in my own little world.

                  Now let's denote <m>f</m> to be a map describing how my metal model
                  might change after exposure to new ideas. Maybe seeing the Netflix 
                  show prompts me to read a bunch of comics or mythology.  In either
                  case, it forms a feedback loop between my model of the comic Konshu
                  and my model of the myth Konshu. Let's call this our set <m>Y</m>
                  and endomap <m>\beta</m>:

                 I'm thinking that the moral of the story here is these endomaps contain
                 more than self-loops, but our insertion <m>J</m> fails to enforce that 
                 condition.  If the endomap contains only self loops it has an insertion
                 that makes a commutative diagram, but just because we have a commutative
                 diagram like this doesn't mean it came from that insertion.

                      Where this gets interesting is when we look at all possible paths we
                      can follow between <m>Y</m> and <m>P</m> in addition to the ones between
                      <m>X</m> and <m>Q</m>.  To follow the pattern of the previous categories,
                      we'd need to enforce all 3 of the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>

                          <m>f_D s = s' f_A</m>
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          <m>f_D t = t' f_A</m>
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          <m>f_A i = i' f_D</m>
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>
                    The order of that last one seems a little bit tricky
                    since our retraction <m>i</m> is heading in the opposite 
                    direction.  At the same time, this map <m>i</m> is presicely
                    what allows us to "solve" for <m>f_D</m> in terms of <m>f_A</m>.
                    In Exercise 15, we saw that this <m>i</m> only works if there's an
                    arrow forming a "self-loop" at each point. All our map <m>f_D</m> 
                    needs to do is match up the self-looping arrows on each point in 
                    <m>P</m> with the corresponding self-looping arrows on <m>Q</m>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's suppose we use the common section <m>i</m> on a point <m>p \in P</m>
                    to produce some arrow <m>x = i p \in X</m>. It follows that this arrow <m>x</m>
                    needs to form a self-loop such that <m>s x = t x = p</m>, since <m>s i = 1_P</m>
                    and <m>t i = 1_P</m> imply <m>s \circ x = s \circ i \circ p = 1_P \circ p = p</m> 
                    and <m>t \circ x = t \circ i \circ p = 1_P \circ p = p</m> respectively. We can 
                    then pair that point with a corresponding self-looping arrow <m>f_A(x) = y \in Y</m>
                    with <m>s'(y) = t'(y) = q</m>. We know such a loop needs to exist because
                    <m>f_D s x = s' f_A x = s' y</m> and <m>f_D t x = t' f_A x = t' y</m> would need
                    to satisfy <m>f_D s x = f_D t x</m>. Finally, we can put this all together to define 
                    <m>f_D p = s' f_A i p = t' f_A i p = q</m> over all possible points in <m>P</m>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I feel like there's probably an easier way to demonstrate this using contradiction.
                  </p>
                  <p>  
                    Suppose for a minute that there did exist some point <m>p</m> which satistfies
                    <m>f_D(p) \neq (s' \circ f_A \circ i)(p)</m>.  You could use the structure 
                    preserving criteria of <m>f_A i = i' f_D</m> to establish that 
                    <m>f_D(p) \neq (s' \circ i' \circ f_D)(p)</m>.  Since we also know <m>s' i' = 1_Q</m>,
                    that previous equation simplifies down to <m>f_D(p) \neq (1_Q \circ f_D)(p)</m>, 
                    which directly contradicts the identity property of <m>1_Q</m>. Our assumption
                    must therefore be false and <m>f_D = s' \circ f_A \circ i</m>. <em>QED</em>.

                <p>
                  At a glance, the structure of this combined diagram resembles a
                  composition of two <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-morphisms
                  with another yet-to-be named structure that's resembles our reflexive
                  graph. I feel like it deserves some cool symbol like
                  <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \uparrow}</m>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let's start with the more familiar structures.  I'd want this map
                  to preserve the behavior of the endomaps <m>\phi_n</m> and <m>\mu_n</m>
                  on each set.  I'd want the maps <m>f_M, f_D</m> to behave like
                  <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-morphisms here.  Specifically,
                  <m>\boxed{M_0^{\circlearrowright \phi_0}} \xrightarrow{f_M} \boxed{M_1^{\circlearrowright \phi_1}}</m> 
                  means that I'd want <m>f_M \circ \phi_0 = \phi_1 f_M</m> and 
                  <m>\boxed{F_0^{\circlearrowright \mu_0}} \xrightarrow{f_F} \boxed{M_1^{\circlearrowright \mu_1}}</m> 
                  means that I'd want <m>f_M \circ \mu_0 = \mu_1 f_F</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the remaining four maps, <m>\mu_n',\phi_n'</m>, we can form
                  multiple paths from <m>M_0</m> to <m>F_1</m> and <m>M_1</m> to <m>F_0</m>.
                  We'd want this map to preserve those relations as well: 
                  <me>f_F \circ \mu_0' = \mu_1' \circ f_M</me> and
                 <me>f_M \circ \phi_0' = \phi_1' \circ f_F</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having a set of four equations to go with four pairs of maps
                  seems consistent we what we saw for the other maps.

              <m>p</m> on the left of both sides:
            </p>
            <me>p a x_0 = p a x_1</me>
            <me>\implies 1_X x_0 = 1_X x_1</me>
            <me>\implies x_0 = x_1</me>
            <p>
              This contradicts our assumption that <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m>, which
              means that no such <m>x_0, x_1</m> exist.  It follows that 
              <m>a x_0 = a x_1 \implies x_0 = x_1</m> and <m>a</m> is injective.

              To show <m>a</m> in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>, we'll need to 
              demonstrate that <m>a \alpha = \beta a</m> over the entire domain <m>\{0,x\}</m>.
              We're given both <m>a 0 = 0</m> and <m>a x = y</m>, so these are fairly trivial:
            </p>
            <me>a \alpha 0 = a 0 = 0</me>
            <me>\beta a 0 = \beta 0 = 0</me>
            <me>\implies a \alpha 0 = \beta a 0</me>
            <me>a \alpha x = a 0 = 0</me>
            <me>\beta a x = \beta y = 0</me>
            <me>\implies a \alpha x = \beta a x</me>
            <p>
              Since those are the only points we have, we can safely
              conclude that <m>a \alpha = \beta a</m>.

                everything to 0 but <m>\bar{y}</m> which it instead sends
                to <m>x</m>.  These two maps make sense when

              <p>
                Thinking back to Exercises 9, the looping behavior of
                our endomap <m>\alpha</m> was based on the property that
                <m>\alpha^3 = \alpha</m>. I'm going to suggest that we 
                can define an <em>n-loop</em> by the existence of endomap
                such that <m>\alpha^{n+1} = \alpha</m> over some subspace
                with that many elements. Then each <em>1-loop</em> would be a 
                <em>fixed point</em> for the endomap and a <em>2-loop</em> 
                would be an <em>antipodal</em> endomap on two points.    
              </p>
              <p>
                So what would these loops look like here? An n-loop in <m>Y</m> 
                would need to be some sequence of <m>\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}</m> 
                where <m>s y_n = t y_{n-1}</m>.  
              </p>
              <p>
                I think the key to is that the equation <m>f_D \circ s = f_D \circ t</m>
                is essentially identifying a fixed point where both the source and target
                of an arrow from <m>X</m> wind up at the same point in <m>Q</m> after the
                transformation. Our category enforces that <m>f_D \circ s = s' \circ f_A</m>
                and <m>f_D \circ t = t' \circ f_A</m>, so it follows that this equation is 
                equivalent to the expression <m>s' \circ f_A = t' \circ f_A</m>. 
                In other words, any <m>x \in X</m> for which <m>(f_D \circ s)(x) = (f_D \circ t)(x)</m>
                would directly correspond with a loop <m>y = f_A x \in Y</m> such that <m>s' y = t' y</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clearly, any self-loop in <m>X</m> must get matched up with a self-loop in <m>Y</m>.  
                If for any <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X</m> we have <m>s x = t x</m>, it follows 
                naturally that both <m>(f_D \circ s)(x) = (f_D \circ t)(x)</m> and 
                <m>(s' \circ f_A)(x) = (t' \circ f_A)(x)</m>.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Suppose we have some arrow in <m>X</m> satisfying <m>(f_D \circ s)(x) = (f_D \circ t)(x)</m> 
                but for which <m>s(x) \neq t(x)</m>.  This needs to map to an arrow <m>y = f_A(x)</m> which
                would need to satisfy the condition that <m>(s' \circ f_A)(x) = (t' \circ f_A)(x)</m>.  It 
                follows that <m>s' y = t' y</m> which forms another self-loop.  So whether or not we start with
                a self-loop in <m>X</m>, we must wind up with one in <m>Y</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                This result seems almost too simple. I was expecting to need to work with loops of varying
                lengths, but it turns out the 1-loops were the only ones I needed.  I may need to come back
                to this later.

            <p>
              I'm thinking that the map <m>\mathbb{Z}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}</m> is the 
              same as the one we used in Exercise 7.  Previously we showed that "multiplying by 5"
              was not an invertable operation on the integers because the reverse operation of
              "dividing by 5" is not defined on the same domain.  Now it looks like we're planning 
              to sidestep that issue by inserting our map in <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's consider a trivial insertion of <m>\mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{Q}</m>
              where we simply define <m>f(x) = x</m>. I guess more specifically, we assign each
              integer <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z} \mathbb{Z}</m> to the rational number
              <m>\frac{z}{1} \in \mathbb{Q}</m>.  In order for this to be a valid 
              <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map, then we'd need 
              <m>\boxed{\mathbb{Z}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}} 
                  \xrightarrow{f} 
                \boxed{\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}}</m> to satisfy the 
                equation <m>f \circ (5 \times ()) = (5 \times ()) \circ f</m>.  This follows
                directly from commutative property of multiplication: 
               <m>x \times 5 = 5 \times x</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since we've already established that we're working with an endomap on <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>,
              to show that <m>\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}</m> is an "automorphism"
              we just need to show it has an inverse.  The inverse function would be given by the 
              map <m>\frac{1}{5} \times ()</m>.  For any <m>q \in \mathbb{Q}</m>, we have 
              <m>\frac{1}{5} \times 5 \times q = q = 5 \times \frac{1}{5} \times q</m>.  It follows that 
              since <m>\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}</m> is both an endomap and invertable, 
              it meets the definition of an automorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
              All that's left is to prove our map <m>f</m> is <em>injective</em>.  For any pair 
              <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z_1} \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z_2} \mathbb{Z}</m>
              such that <m>f z_1 = f z_2</m>, our choice of <m>f</m> implies this statement 
              is equivalent to <m>\frac{z_1}{1} = z_1 = z_2 = \frac{z_2}{1}</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way to think of this would be that <m>f</m> is injective when it has a 
              <em>retraction</em>.  In this case, the map <m>\mathbb{Q} \xrightarrow{r} \mathbb{Z}</m>
              given by <m>r(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor</m> meets this condition.  For any
              <m>z \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>r f z = r \frac{z}{1} = \lfloor \frac{z}{1} \rfloor = z</m>

              and an automorphism <m>Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>, we want to show any 
              <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map 
              <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha} \xrightarrow{f} Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>
              must be non-injective.  Our "hint" is that the map must send both elements
              of <m>X</m> to the same fixed point in <m>Y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It follows from the definition of <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map
              that <m>f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f</m>.  However, <m>\beta</m> is given
              as an <em>automorphism</em> which means it must have some inverse map 
              <m>Y \xrightarrow{\beta^{-1}} Y</m> such that 
              <m>\beta \circ \beta^{-1} = \beta^{-1} \circ \beta = 1_Y</m>. 
              Apply this map <m>\beta^{-1}</m> to the left sides of our earlier expression 
              to get <m>\beta^{-1} \circ f \circ \alpha = f</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since there's literally only two elements in <m>X</m>, let's call them 
              <m>\{x_0,x_1\}</m> and denote the behavior of <m>\alpha</m> by <m>\alpha x = x_0</m>
              for <m>x \in X</m>.  It follows from <m>\beta^{-1} \circ f \circ \alpha = f</m>
              that <m>f x_0 = \beta^{-1} f \alpha x_0 = \beta^{-1} f x_0</m> is a "fixed point" in
              <m>Y</m> since <m>f x_0 = \beta^{-1} f x_0 \implies \beta f x_0 = f x_0</m>.  It 
              also follows that <m>f x_1 = \beta^{-1} f \alpha 1 = \beta^{-1} f x_0</m> returns the
              same fixed point.  Having shown that <m>f x_0 = f x_1</m> for some <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m>,
              we've demonstrated that <m>f</m> is non-injective.

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Given that we have an injective map 
              <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha} \xrightarrow{f} Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>,
              it must also have some retraction <m>Y \xrightarrow{r_f} X</m> such 
              that <m>r_f \circ f = 1_X</m>.  We're also given that <m>\beta</m> is an 
              automorphism, which guarantees it has an inverse <m>\beta^{-1}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to prove that <m>\alpha</m> itself must be injective.  It suffices
              to show there exists a retraction <m>r_\alpha \circ \alpha = 1_X</m>.
              I'm going to claim that the map <m>r_\alpha = r_f \circ \beta^{-1} \circ f</m>
              should have this desired property.  
            </p>
            <p>
              We can use this definition to expand the expression <m>r_\alpha \circ \alpha</m>:
            </p> 
            <me>r_\alpha \circ \alpha = r_f \circ \beta^{-1} \circ f \circ \alpha</me>
            <p>
              As a <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map, we know <m>f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f</m>:
            </p>
            <me>r_\alpha \circ \alpha = r_f \circ \beta^{-1} \circ \beta \circ f</me>
            <me> = r_f \circ 1_Y \circ f</me>
            <me> = r_f \circ f = 1_X</me>
            <p>
              And there we have it!

          <solution>
            <p>
              There's an awful lot to unpack here so lets start with a <em>category</em>.  
              We know we have some sets of objects <m>x \in X</m> or <m>y \in Y</m> and maps
              <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m> which obey the identity and associative properties
              over the domain and codomain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of the article, we've seen that there's a natural insertion
              of this map into the category <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>.
              For each pair of object <m>x \in X</m> and <m>y \in Y</m> such that <m>f x = y</m>,
              we can think of the map <m>f</m> as a collection of "arrows" with a <em>source</em>
              at <m>x</m> which we indicate <m>s x = x</m> and a <em>target</em> object at
              <m>y</m> which we indicate <m>t x = y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              From what I gather, our <m>\mathcal{A}</m> supplements this insertion with
              an arbitrary number of additional properties <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}</m>.
              Each individual property <m>a_n \in A</m> gets a corresponding map 
              <m>\alpha_n</m>  that returns the value of the property
              with that name.  For any property map <m>\alpha</m>,
              we can either access this property <em>before</em> we apply the map <m>f</m>
              or <em>after</em>. This provides  natural defintion of preserving the structure
               of each property so that <m>\alpha f = f \alpha</m> as follows:

                  Our <m>\mathcal{A}</m>-figures must satisfy these conditions
                  for <em>every</em> property. If that's the case, then we can
                  embed our <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>-map
                  representation of <m>f</m> by treating our maps <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>
                  as "just another property" in an <m>\mathcal{A}</m>-figure.

                  The <m>\mathcal{A}</m>-structure would preserves the the source
                  and targets of our map <m>f</m>.  Essentially, each map 
                  <m>f: X \longrightarrow Y</m> can be expressed as an 
                  <m>\mathcal{A}</m>-structure with two components if we 
                  let <m>\alpha_0</m> be our "source" map and <m>\alpha_1</m>
                  be our "target" map.

              <p>
                I'm not entirely sure, but I think the existence of such 
                an embedding would reasonably demonstrate this notion 
                of "giving rise to a map in the category".
