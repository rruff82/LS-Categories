        <title>What is this?</title>
        <p>I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel on my own and it's been kind of difficult.  
          Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an
          effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, it seemed like this would be a good opportunity for me to simulaneously learn how to work with <pretext />.  
          I've done a lot of work using LaTeX for equations before but I'm expecting this content gives me some much needed practice rendering 
          diagrams with the TiKz package.
