    <title>Session 2</title>
    <p>
      It feels kind of silly to post solutions to a problem set that 
      includes the answers already, but this seems like a good opportunity
      to validate my generalization from last week.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Problems on the number of maps from one set to another</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many maps...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We have answers here, so let's confirm the results of the generalization from Article 1:
        </p>
        <table>
        <tabular>
<row header="yes" bottom="minor">
    <cell>#</cell>
    <cell><m>||A||</m></cell>
    <cell><m>||B||</m></cell>
    <cell>Expression</cell>
    <cell>Result</cell>
<cell>Correct</cell>
</row>
<row>
    <cell>1</cell>
    <cell>4</cell>
    <cell>1</cell>
    <cell><m>1^4</m></cell>
    <cell>1</cell>
<cell>YES</cell>
</row>
<row>
    <cell>2</cell>
    <cell>1</cell>
    <cell>4</cell>
    <cell><m>4^1</m></cell>
    <cell>4</cell>
<cell>YES</cell>
</row>
<row>
    <cell>3</cell>
    <cell>0</cell>
    <cell>4</cell>
    <cell><m>4^0</m></cell>
    <cell>1</cell>
<cell>YES</cell>
</row>
 <row>
    <cell>4</cell>
    <cell>4</cell>
    <cell>0</cell>
    <cell><m>0^4</m></cell>
    <cell>0</cell>
<cell>YES</cell>
</row>
<row>
    <cell>5</cell>
    <cell>0</cell>
    <cell>0</cell>
    <cell><m>0^0</m></cell>
    <cell>"it depends"</cell>
<cell>"mostly"</cell>
</row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>
The generalization seems to hold up, provided we define our exponential operator
in such a way that <m>0^0=1</m>. This is a common practice, but I've also seen
situations where <m>0^0</m> is left undefined instead.  In this context, the answer
of 1 to problem 5 makes more sense than than the alternative.  In programming terms,
it seems perfectly reasonable to think of "no op" as a "function" so there should be
an analogous "null map" that maps from nothing to nothing.
