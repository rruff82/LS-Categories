    <title>Session 15: Objectification of Properties</title>
    <p>
        This week was an interesting development.  Up until this
        point we've only been using numbers as a playground for exploring
        ideas.  Now that monoids have allowed us to build a formalization
        of natural numbers in the category of endomaps, we've opened
        up a whole new means of analyzing maps.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My prediction about cycle lenths and divisibility was spot on.
        It was nice to have confirmation that I'm on the right track. 
        I also found the definition of <m>\Omega</m> was rather intriguing. 
        I can see this having applications to things like "floating point"
        numbers where treating infinity as a number has advantages. In fact, 
        a lot of idea from throughout the text seem to be coming together. 
        <em>Slowly</em>.

      <title>Exercise 1:</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          ...both period 5 and period 7...
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <p>
          Suppose we have some element <m>x_0 \in X^{\circlearrowright \alpha}</m> 
          with <m>\alpha^ 5 x_0 = x_0 = \alpha^7 x_0</m>.  Our associative property
          implies <m>\alpha^7 x_0 = \alpha ^2 \circ \alpha^5 x_0 = \alpha^2 x_0</m>.
          However,  <m>\alpha^7 x_0</m> is just <m>x_0</m> so it follows that
          <m>\alpha^2 x_0 = x_0</m>.   And if that's the case, then we can
          also represent <m>\alpha^6 x_0</m> as either 
          <m>\alpha^2 \circ \alpha^2 \circ \alpha^2 x_0 = x_0</m> or
          <m>\alpha \circ \alpha^5 x_0 = \alpha x_0</m>. 
      </p>
      <p> 
          In the former case, <m>\alpha^2 = 1_X</m> implies 
          <m>\alpha^6 x_0 = \alpha^2 \circ \alpha^2 \circ \alpha^2 x_0 = x_0</m>.
          In the latter, <m>\alpha^5 = 1_X</m> implies 
          <m>\alpha^6 x_0 = \alpha \circ \alpha^5 x_0 = \alpha x_0</m>.
          Since both are equivalent to <m>\alpha^6 x_0</m>, we have 
          established that <m>\alpha x_0 = x_0</m> which proves <m>x_0</m> is a fixed point.
      </p>

      <title>Exercise 2:</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
                ...all maps from <m>\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \alpha}</m> to
          <m>C_4</m>...  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In order to preserve structure, the arrows need to flow in the same direction.
          Any map <m>\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \sigma} \rightarrow C_4</m> that preserve the 
          structure of the loop.  That is, whatever point we decide to send
          <m>0</m> to in the cycle determines where we need to send <m>1,2,3</m>.  Once 
          we hit <m>4</m> we need to loop back to <m>0</m>.
      </p>

          These 4 possible permutations are diagrammed below:

          I'm not exactly what this exercise is asking, so let's start by 
          laying out the context.
        </p>

          <caption>Iteration and evaluation defined</caption>

          <latex-image>
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]
  
  \draw (-1,-2) rectangle (3,2);
  \node (A) at (1,1) {Maps in $\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}$};
  \node (B) at (1,-1) {$\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \sigma} \rightarrow Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}$};
  
  \draw (8,-2) rectangle (12,2);
  \node (C) at (10,1) {Maps in $\mathcal{S}$};

  \path[-{Stealth},font=\scriptsize,>=angle 90] 
    ($(A)+(2.5,0)$) edge node[above] {evaluation at 0} ($(C)-(2.5,0)$)
    ($(D)-(2.5,0)$) edge node[below] {iteration} ($(B)+(2.5,0)$)

          We're told that "'Iteration' assigns to each
          <m>y</m> in <m>Y</m> the map <m>f</m> given by
          <m>f(n) = \beta^n(y)</m>".
        </p>
        <p>
          I think my confusion here is stemming from a little uncertainty about
          the domain and codomain of <m>f</m>.  The diagram
          I recreated above suggests that <m>f</m> is a map
          <m>\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \sigma} \rightarrow Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>, but part 
          of me thinks I should treat <m>f</m> as an abitrary map
          <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha} \rightarrow Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m> in the context
          of a broader category of <m>\mathcal{S}^\circlearrowright</m>.
          Part of me is wondering if our definition of <m>\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \sigma}</m>
          as a <em>monoid</em> circumvents this question entirely by defining 
          <m>0</m> as an element of <m>X</m> with the desired property in <m>\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \sigma}</m>:
          a point that is the origin of an arrow but not a target.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some of the earlier Sessions, I found it helpful to
          think about the "image" produced by a given map.
          Once we have a point <m>y \in Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m> 
          we can ask whether or not <m>\beta y = y</m> produces a fixed 
          point. This is a <em>binary</em> question for which the 
          answer either needs to be "true" or "false".  Let's call this 
          space <m>\mathbf{2} = \{0,1\}</m> with the conventions <m>0 = \text{false}</m> if 
          <m>\beta y = y</m> and <m>1 = \text{true}</m> if <m>\beta y \neq y</m>. Let's define this map as 
          <m>Y^{\circlearrowright \beta} \xrightarrow{g} \mathbf{2}^{\circlearrowright \gamma}</m>.
       </p>
       <p>
          Obviously such map exists between sets, but the real question is whether 
          or not <m>\gamma</m> <em>preserves structure</em> within our category.  There are precisely
          4 possible endomaps <m>\gamma</m> on <m>\mathbf{2}</m> we could possibly have: 
          an identity map, an antipodal map, and two idempotents 
          resulting in <m>0, 1</m> respectively.  This allows us to ask further questions,
          like if <m>\gamma</m> is has a <em>retraction</em>.  Of the four possible endomaps
          on <m>\mathbf{2}</m>, only the identity map and the antipodal map would even qualify 
          because we know there's no possible retraction from <m>\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>. 
       </p>
       <p>
          This is all still really fuzzy and I feel like I'm missing something, so I think I'm going
          to let this information stew for another week and come back to it..
