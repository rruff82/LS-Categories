    <p>
      The end of the Article 3 is within sight!  I'm starting to feel a little 
      bit better about my solution to Exercise 14 earlier and I'm glad I explored
      some small permutations in advance of Exercise 26.  Let's see if we can 
      formalize a notion of <em>loops</em> to wrap up this Article.

        <p>
          Given a <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>-map
          between two graphs, we want to show <m>f_D \circ s = f_D \circ t</m> can only 
          be true when <m>f_A</m> maps every arrow in <m>X</m> to a <em>loop</em> in
          <m>Y</m>.  Our external diagram is reproduced below:

          <p>
            Thinking back to Exercises 9, the looping behavior of
            our endomap <m>\alpha</m> was based on the property that
            <m>\alpha^3 = \alpha</m>. I'm going to suggest that we 
            can define an <em>n-loop</em> by the existence of endomap
            such that <m>\alpha^{n+1} = \alpha</m> over some subspace
            with that many elements. Then each <em>1-loop</em> would be a 
            <em>fixed point</em> for the endomap and a <em>2-loop</em> 
            would be an <em>antipodal</em> endomap on two points.    
          </p>
          <p>
            So what would these loops look like here? An n-loop in <m>Y</m> 
            would need to be some sequence of <m>\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}</m> 
            where <m>s y_n = t y_{n-1}</m>.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I think the key to is that the equation <m>f_D \circ s = f_D \circ t</m>
            is essentially identifying a fixed point where both the source and target
            of an arrow from <m>X</m> wind up at the same point in <m>Q</m> after the
            transformation. Our category enforces that <m>f_D \circ s = s' \circ f_A</m>
            and <m>f_D \circ t = t' \circ f_A</m>, so it follows that this equation is 
            equivalent to the expression <m>s' \circ f_A = t' \circ f_A</m>. 
            In other words, any <m>x \in X</m> for which <m>(f_D \circ s)(x) = (f_D \circ t)(x)</m>
            would directly correspond with a loop <m>y = f_A x \in Y</m> such that <m>s' y = t' y</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, any self-loop in <m>X</m> must get matched up with a self-loop in <m>Y</m>.  
            If for any <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X</m> we have <m>s x = t x</m>, it follows 
            naturally that both <m>(f_D \circ s)(x) = (f_D \circ t)(x)</m> and 
            <m>(s' \circ f_A)(x) = (t' \circ f_A)(x)</m>.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose we have some arrow in <m>X</m> satisfying <m>(f_D \circ s)(x) = (f_D \circ t)(x)</m> 
            but for which <m>s(x) \neq t(x)</m>.  This needs to map to an arrow <m>y = f_A(x)</m> which
            would need to satisfy the condition that <m>(s' \circ f_A)(x) = (t' \circ f_A)(x)</m>.  It 
            follows that <m>s' y = t' y</m> which forms another self-loop.  So whether or not we start with
            a self-loop in <m>X</m>, we must wind up with one in <m>Y</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This result seems almost too simple. I was expecting to need to work with loops of varying
            lengths, but it turns out the 1-loops were the only ones I needed.  I may need to come back
            to this later.

      <title>Exercise 26:</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is an 'inclusion' map...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I'm thinking that the map <m>\mathbb{Z}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}</m> is the 
          same as the one we used in Exercise 7.  Previously we showed that "multiplying by 5"
          was not an invertable operation on the integers because the reverse operation of
          "dividing by 5" is not defined on the same domain.  Now it looks like we're planning 
          to sidestep that issue by inserting our map in <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's consider a trivial insertion of <m>\mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{Q}</m>
          where we simply define <m>f(x) = x</m>. I guess more specifically, we assign each
          integer <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z} \mathbb{Z}</m> to the rational number
          <m>\frac{z}{1} \in \mathbb{Q}</m>.  In order for this to be a valid 
          <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map, then we'd need 
          <m>\boxed{\mathbb{Z}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}} 
              \xrightarrow{f} 
            \boxed{\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}}</m> to satisfy the 
            equation <m>f \circ (5 \times ()) = (5 \times ()) \circ f</m>.  This follows
            directly from commutative property of multiplication: 
           <m>x \times 5 = 5 \times x</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we've already established that we're working with an endomap on <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>,
          to show that <m>\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}</m> is an "automorphism"
          we just need to show it has an inverse.  The inverse function would be given by the 
          map <m>\frac{1}{5} \times ()</m>.  For any <m>q \in \mathbb{Q}</m>, we have 
          <m>\frac{1}{5} \times 5 \times q = q = 5 \times \frac{1}{5} \times q</m>.  It follows that 
          since <m>\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}</m> is both an endomap and invertable, 
          it meets the definition of an automorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that's left is to prove our map <m>f</m> is <em>injective</em>.  For any pair 
          <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z_1} \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z_2} \mathbb{Z}</m>
          such that <m>f z_1 = f z_2</m>, our choice of <m>f</m> implies this statement 
          is equivalent to <m>\frac{z_1}{1} = z_1 = z_2 = \frac{z_2}{1}</m>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to think of this would be that <m>f</m> is injective when it has a 
          <em>retraction</em>.  In this case, the map <m>\mathbb{Q} \xrightarrow{r} \mathbb{Z}</m>
          given by <m>r(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor</m> meets this condition.  For any
          <m>z \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>r f z = r \frac{z}{1} = \lfloor \frac{z}{1} \rfloor = z</m>
          so <m>r \circ f = 1_{\mathbb{Z}}</m>.

          and an automorphism <m>Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>, we want to show any 
          <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map 
          <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha} \xrightarrow{f} Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>
          must be non-injective.  Our "hint" is that the map must send both elements
          of <m>X</m> to the same fixed point in <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It follows from the definition of <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map
          that <m>f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f</m>.  However, <m>\beta</m> is given
          as an <em>automorphism</em> which means it must have some inverse map 
          <m>Y \xrightarrow{\beta^{-1}} Y</m> such that 
          <m>\beta \circ \beta^{-1} = \beta^{-1} \circ \beta = 1_Y</m>. 
          Apply this map <m>\beta^{-1}</m> to the left sides of our earlier expression 
          to get <m>\beta^{-1} \circ f \circ \alpha = f</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there's literally only two elements in <m>X</m>, let's call them 
          <m>\{x_0,x_1\}</m> and denote the behavior of <m>\alpha</m> by <m>\alpha x = x_0</m>
          for <m>x \in X</m>.  It follows from <m>\beta^{-1} \circ f \circ \alpha = f</m>
          that <m>f x_0 = \beta^{-1} f \alpha x_0 = \beta^{-1} f x_0</m> is a "fixed point" in
          <m>Y</m> since <m>f x_0 = \beta^{-1} f x_0 \implies \beta f x_0 = f x_0</m>.  It 
          also follows that <m>f x_1 = \beta^{-1} f \alpha 1 = \beta^{-1} f x_0</m> returns the
          same fixed point.  Having shown that <m>f x_0 = f x_1</m> for some <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m>,
          we've demonstrated that <m>f</m> is non-injective.

          Given that we have an injective map 
          <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha} \xrightarrow{f} Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>,
          it must also have some retraction <m>Y \xrightarrow{r_f} X</m> such 
          that <m>r_f \circ f = 1_X</m>.  We're also given that <m>\beta</m> is an 
          automorphism, which guarantees it has an inverse <m>\beta^{-1}</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to prove that <m>\alpha</m> itself must be injective.  It suffices
          to show there exists a retraction <m>r_\alpha \circ \alpha = 1_X</m>.
          I'm going to claim that the map <m>r_\alpha = r_f \circ \beta^{-1} \circ f</m>
          should have this desired property.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use this definition to expand the expression <m>r_\alpha \circ \alpha</m>:

        <me>r_\alpha \circ \alpha = r_f \circ \beta^{-1} \circ f \circ \alpha</me>
        <p>
          As a <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>-map, we know <m>f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f</m>:

        <me>r_\alpha \circ \alpha = r_f \circ \beta^{-1} \circ \beta \circ f</me>

        <me> = r_f \circ f = 1_X</me>

      <statement>Every map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m> in <m>\mathcal{X}</m>...</statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There's an awful lot to unpack here so lets start with a <em>category</em>.  
          We know we have some sets of objects <m>x \in X</m> or <m>y \in Y</m> and maps
          <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m> which obey the identity and associative properties
          over the domain and codomain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of the article, we've seen that there's a natural insertion
          of this map into the category <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow^{\bullet}_{\bullet} \downarrow}</m>.
          For each pair of object <m>x \in X</m> and <m>y \in Y</m> such that <m>f x = y</m>,
          we can think of the map <m>f</m> as a collection of "arrows" with a <em>source</em>
          at <m>x</m> which we indicate <m>s x = x</m> and a <em>target</em> object at
          <m>y</m> which we indicate <m>t x = y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what I gather, our <m>\mathcal{A}</m> supplements this insertion with
          an arbitrary number of additional properties <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}</m>.
          Each individual property <m>a_n \in A</m> gets a corresponding map 
          <m>\alpha_n</m>  that returns the value of the property
          with that name.  For any property map <m>\alpha</m>,
          we can either access this property <em>before</em> we apply the map <m>f</m>
          or <em>after</em>. This provides  natural defintion of preserving the structure
           of each property so that <m>\alpha f = f \alpha</m> as follows:

              The <m>\mathcal{A}</m>-structure would preserves the the source
              and targets of our map <m>f</m>.  Essentially, each map 
              <m>f: X \longrightarrow Y</m> can be expressed as an 
              <m>\mathcal{A}</m>-structure with two components if we 
              let <m>\alpha_0</m> be our "source" map and <m>\alpha_1</m>
              be our "target" map.

            I'm not entirely sure, but I think the existence of such 
            an embedding would reasonably demonstrate this notion 
            of "giving rise to a map in the category".

      I know there's only one problem left here, but it's already 
      Caturday and I want to give it the time it deserves.  Until next time!
