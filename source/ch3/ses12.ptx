    <title>Session 12: Categories of Diagrams</title>

    <p>
        I thought that the Session following my bookmark was going
        to be difficult, but this was actually a relatively easy 
        reading this week.  I'm enjoying the sessions written in 
        this style where the association between the abstract 
        representations and the practical uses are laid out in 
        an imaginary classroom.  It makes me feel like I'm a
        part of collective effort to understand this.

    <example>
        <title>Exercise 1:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Suppose that <m>x' = \alpha^3(x)</m>...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>

            <p> We're given that
                <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha} 
                        \xrightarrow{f}
                 Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m> is a map in
                 <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}</m>, which 
                 tells us that <m>f \alpha = \beta f</m>. 
                 If we know that we have some <m>x' = \alpha^3(x)</m>,
                 we could sketch the external diagram as follows:

                for some <m>f(x) = y</m>, we can establish that <m>f(x') = y'</m>
                through the associative property:

            <me>y' = \beta^3(y) = \beta \beta \beta f x</me>
            <me>= \beta \beta f \alpha x</me>

            <me>= f(\alpha^3(x)) = f(x')</me>
            <p>
                Thus, <m>y' = f(x')</m>.

                Rather than just replicating the entire diagram here,
                I'll just focus on the relevant "clusters". Let's start with
                the set of points connected to <m>y</m>. The pre-periodic behavior
                will be dashed  while the periodic behavior solid black.  Grey will 
                denote paths not taken.

                Finally, let's sketch the hypthotical enodmap of a light switch
                that could only be lit four times.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm going to suggest that the first state be called <m>\text{off}_0</m>.
                The first time we flip the switch, we'd get <m>\text{on}_0</m>. 
                Then we alternate between "off" and "on", until we have a set of 4 
                "on" states: <m>\{\text{on}_0,\text{on}_1,\text{on}_2,\text{on}_3 \}</m>.
                Following that final on, we reach a terminal state that is perpetually "off".
                Putting the whole thing together might look something like this:

                The only thing that strikes me as being tricky about this
                was that my "off" and "on" states had to be different for 
                each time the light was switched.  Even though looking at the 
                light buld you'd only see whether the light was on or off, there
                needs to be an internal state to the light bulb that tracks how
                many times it's been used.

                Well, we have some objects.  These include the people and properties 
                we're looking at.  We also have some maps that relate our people and 
                and properties with each other.  We're particularly concerned 
                with a 'gender' map I'll call <m>\mathbf{P} \xrightarrow{\gamma} \mathbf{G}</m>
                which takes a person and returns a gender.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have objects representing the domain and codomain
                of our map <m>g</m>. The domain <m>\mathbf{P}</m> is
                the set of all people and the codomain is the set of genders
                <m>\mathbf{P}</m>.  We'll also have two identity maps
                <m>1_\mathbf{P}</m> and <m>1_\mathbf{G}</m> which can 
                satisfy <m>1_\mathbf{G} \circ g = g = g \circ 1_\mathbf{P}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For us to define a composition of maps, let's first identify
                the structures we want to preserve.  Our "people space" came
                equipped with two endomaps <m>\mathbf{P} \xrightarrow{m} \mathbf{P}</m> and
                <m>\mathbf{P} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbf{P}</m> that take a person and return the
                person's "mother" or "father" respectively. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This object <m>\mathbf{G}</m> does something interesting here
                by defining it's own version of those endomaps <m>f, m</m>. 
                These maps operate on <em>genders</em> rather than <em>people</em>,
                but defining them this way allows us to preserve the structure.
                Perhaps it might be clearer if denote them separately.  Let's call
                <m>f_P, m_P</m> the endomaps on people and <m>f_G, m_G</m>
                the endomaps on genders.  We could compose maps to form the 
                following commutative diagram:

                In order to maintain our structure, we'd want to have both
                <m>m_G g = g m_P</m> and <m>f_G g = g f_P</m>.  Fortunately,
                <m>m_G</m> and <m>f_G</m> are basically constants in <m>\mathbf{G}</m>.
                For any given person <m>p \in \mathbf{P}</m> (in this model), we could 
                potentially have <m>g p = \text{female}</m> or <m>g p = \text{male}</m>, but
                if we compose with our endomaps <m>m, f</m> we get fixed points.
                For any person <m>p</m>, we can expect that their mother is female (both 
                <m>g m_P p = \text{female}</m> and <m>m_G g p = \text{female}</m>) 
                and father is male (both <m>g f_P p = \text{male}</m> and
                <m>f_G g p = \text{male}</m>). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm thinking that central idea of part (a) is to define a map <m>g</m> in
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft \circlearrowright}</m>
                as a map <m>{}^{m \circlearrowleft} \mathrm{A}^{\circlearrowright f}
                \xrightarrow{g} {}^{m' \circlearrowleft} \mathrm{B}^{\circlearrowright f'}</m>          
                satisfying the pair of equations <m>m' g = g m</m> and <m>f' g = g f</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Given some other map <m>h</m> in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft \circlearrowright}</m>,
                with <m>{}^{m' \circlearrowleft} \mathrm{B}^{\circlearrowright f'}
                 \xrightarrow{h} {}^{m'' \circlearrowleft} \mathrm{C}^{\circlearrowright f'''}</m>
                 we'd need to show that our composition <m>h \circ g</m> is also a
                 valid <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft \circlearrowright}</m>-map.
                 This should follow directly from the associative property and our structure
                 preserving equations:
            </p>
            <me>(h \circ g) m = h g m = h m' g = m'' h g = m'' \circ (h \circ g)</me>
            <me>(h \circ g) f = h g f = h f' g = f'' h g = f'' \circ (h \circ g)</me>
            <p>
                The last thing we need to verify is the associative property.  Given 
                a third map <m>i</m> in  <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft \circlearrowright}</m>,
                with <m>{}^{m'' \circlearrowleft} \mathrm{C}^{\circlearrowright f''}
                 \xrightarrow{i} {}^{m''' \circlearrowleft} \mathrm{D}^{\circlearrowright f'''}</m>,
                 we want to show <m>(i \circ h) \circ g = i \circ (h \circ g)</m>. I'm
                 pretty sure we get this for free as being objects in the category of sets.   
            </p>
            <p>
                For part (b), we expand our structure with a "clan" object defined as follows:

            <p>
                Like before, we'd want our structure to be preserved.  Given a map
                <m>
                    {}^{m \circlearrowleft} \mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowright f} 
                    \xrightarrow{c}
                     {}^{m' \circlearrowleft} \mathbf{C}^{\circlearrowright f'}</m>,
                we'd want to enforce the conditions that 
                <m>c \circ m = m' \circ c</m> and <m>c \circ f = f' \circ c</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since "a child's clan is the same as that of [their] mother", it follows
                that for any person <m>p</m> we'd have <m>c p = c m p</m>.  As a result, 
                our condition that <m>c \circ m = m' \circ c</m> is satisfied by making
                <m>m' = 1_C</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since "[m]arriages within clans are forbidden", it follows that for any
                person <m>p</m> we'd have <m>c f p \neq c m p</m>.  However, we already 
                know <m>c m p = c p</m> so it follows that <m>c f p \neq c p</m>. Since 
                there's only two elements in <m>\mathbf{C}</m> it follows that <m>f'</m> 
                needs the <em>antipodal</em> map so that 
                <m>c \circ f = f' \circ c \neq c</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last part (c), we attempt to combine "gender" and "clan" to make a 
                cartesian product: <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m>.  Essentially,
                there are four possible combinations of clan and gender: he-wolf, she-wolf,
                he-bear, and she-bear.  We'll examine each in turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a "he-wolf", his mother needs to be a "she-wolf" and father a "he-bear".
                For a "she-wolf", her mother needs to be a "she-wolf and father a "he-bear".
                For a "he-bear", his mother needs to be a "she-bear" and father a "he-wolf".
                For a "she-bear", her mother needs to be a "she-bear" and father a "he-wolf".
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we assign a "mother arrow" and a "father arrow" for each point, we can 
                draw an endomap diagram representing the relations:
