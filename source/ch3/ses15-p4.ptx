    <title>Session 15: Objectification of Properties, Part 4</title>
    <p>
        So... here's the deal.  This week has been completely devoted to
        a single exercise.  I might not even have a satisfactory solution by the
        end of this, but that's okay.  Learning math is sometimes messy like this.
        Sometimes all you can do is just lay out the information you know and
        start asking questions, so that's what you do.  
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Exercise 7:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                <p>
                    ...  <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha}</m> above to <m>Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m> above... 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Before we begin, I want to preface this with an additional spoiler.  I got really stuck 
                    at 12/14 maps.  If you're stuck there also, I'd encourage you to take a break from it.
                    I know I needed it.

                Let's begin with some diagrams of our endomaps:

            <p>
                I'm going to try to adhere to the text as closely as I can for now.
                Thus, <m>X^{\circlearrowright \alpha}</m> has been labeled using it's 
                presentation already with the generators given as <m>\{a,b,c,d\}</m>.
                Our presention includes following 4 relations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\alpha^5 a = \alpha^2 a</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\alpha^2 a = \alpha b</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\alpha^3 a = \alpha c</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\alpha^2 d = d</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We're looking for maps <m>f</m> for which these generators
                from <m>X</m> get assigned to points in <m>Y</m> such that
                <m>(f \circ \alpha)(x) = (\beta \circ f)(x)</m> for every 
                <m>x \in X</m>.   For now, we're not sure what assignments 
                will make that happen so we'll just call these mystery points
                <m>f(a) = \bar{a}</m>, <m>f(b) = \bar{b}</m>, <m>f(c) = \bar{c}</m>, 
                and <m>f(d) = \bar{d}</m>.  Since we established that
                <m>f \alpha^n = \beta^n f</m> for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
                we can match each of our relations on <m>X</m> with a corresponding
                relation on <m>Y</m>:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\beta^5 \bar{a} = \beta^2 \bar{a}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta \bar{b}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta \bar{c}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\beta^2 \bar{d} = \bar{d}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Beginning with the generator <m>\bar{a}</m>, we're going 
                to look for a list potential points in <m>Y</m> that satisfy 
                our first relation: <m>\beta^5 \bar{a} = \beta^2 \bar{a}</m>.
                The textbook helps us out by pointing out that <m>w,x,y,z</m>
                meet this condition but <m>l,m,p,q,r,s,t,u,v</m> do not. Thus,
                we can make four possible assignments for <m>a</m>: 
                <m>\{\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{a} \rightarrow x, 
                    \bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{a} \rightarrow z\}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If we assign <m>\bar{a} \rightarrow w</m>, we can apply the operator 
                <m>\beta</m> until we form a loop.  If we do so, we find
                that <m>\beta \bar{a} = \beta w = x</m>, 
                <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta x = y</m>, and 
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta y = w</m>. Our second relation implies
                that <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta \bar{b}</m>, but we already know 
                <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = y</m> so that means that whatever we choose 
                for <m>\bar{b}</m> must satisfy <m>\beta \bar{b} = y</m>.  In the 
                diagram, the only arrows leading into point <m>y</m> are the arrows
                originating at <m>x, z</m>.   Thus our only valid assignments for 
                <m>\bar{b}</m>, given <m>\bar{a} \rightarrow w</m>, are <m>\bar{b} \rightarrow x</m> and 
                <m>\bar{b} \rightarrow z</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given these two choices of <m>\bar{b}</m>, we can start to narrow 
                down our choices of <m>\bar{c}</m> as well.  If we assume that 
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = w = \beta \bar{c}</m> implies that 
                <m>\bar{c}</m> must have an arrow leading to point <m>w</m>.  
                Presicely one point has that property, namely <m>y</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Our final relation specifies that <m>m>\beta^2 \bar{d} = \bar{d}</m>,
                and there's only one 2-cycle in <m>Y</m> that could satisfy this.  
                This means that <m>\bar{d}</m> needs to be either <m>l</m> or 
                <m>m</m>.  Having exhausted all possibilities for maps such 
                that <m>\bar{a} \rightarrow w</m>, we're currently sitting
                on a list of 4 maps: 
                    <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow x, 
                        \bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]</m>,
                    <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow z, 
                        \bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]</m>,
                    <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow x, 
                        \bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]</m>,
                    <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow z, 
                        \bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]</m>,        
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving on, our next possible assignment is <m>\bar{a} \rightarrow x</m>. 
                Iterating from there gives us the following: 
                <m>\beta \bar{a} = \beta x = y</m>, 
                <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta y = w</m>, and 
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta w = x</m>.
            </p>
            <p> 
                As before, our second relation limits our choice of <m>\bar{b}</m>.
                Knowing <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = w = \beta \bar{b}</m> tell us 
                that there must be an arrow from <m>\bar{b}</m> to <m>w</m>,
                and the only arrow with a target of <m>w</m> is the one originating
                at point <m>y</m>.  Thus, <m>\bar{a} = w \implies \bar{b} = y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Testing our third relation places limits on <m>\bar{c}</m>.  Since
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = x = \beta \bar{c}</m>, the needs to be an
                arrow from point <m>\bar{c}</m> to <m>x</m> and this is uniquely
                satisfied by point <m>w</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Our choices for <m>\bar{d}</m> are still independent of our choices for
                <m>\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c}</m>, specifically <m>\bar{d} = \{l,m\}</m>.
                This gives us two new maps, 
                <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow x, \bar{b} \rightarrow y, 
                    \bar{c} \rightarrow w, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]</m> and
                    <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow x, \bar{b} \rightarrow y, 
                        \bar{c} \rightarrow w, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]</m>,
                bringing our running total of maps to 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our third option for <m>\bar{a}</m> is <m>y</m>.  If we assign
                <m>\bar{a} \rightarrow y</m>, it follows that
                <m>\beta \bar{a} = \beta y = w</m>, 
                <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta w = x</m>, and 
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta x = y</m>.  Since 
                <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = x = \beta \bar{b}</m>, it follows that
                <m>\bar{b}</m> must be <m>w</m> because there's only one arrow
                leading into <m>x</m>.  With our third relation telling us
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = y = \beta \bar{c}</m>, that tells us
                that our choice of <m>\bar{c}</m> must have an arrow leading
                to <m>y</m>.  Two such points satisfy this, namely <m>x,z</m>. 
                For each of those choices of <m>\bar{c}</m>, there are still
                two independent choices for <m>\bar{d}</m>. This gives us
                a total of 4 maps with <m>\bar{a} \rightarrow y</m> bringing our 
                running total to 10.  Specifically,  our new maps are
                <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{b} \rightarrow w, 
                    \bar{c} \rightarrow x, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]</m>,
                <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{b} \rightarrow w, 
                    \bar{c} \rightarrow z, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]</m>,
                <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{b} \rightarrow w, 
                    \bar{c} \rightarrow x, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]</m>,
                    and
                <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{b} \rightarrow w, 
                    \bar{c} \rightarrow x, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our final choice for <m>\bar{a}</m> is <m>z</m>.  Going through
                our algorithm again, we start be iterating to get
                <m>\beta \bar{a} = \beta z = y</m>, 
                <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta y = w</m>, and 
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta w = x</m>.  Our <m>\bar{b}</m> 
                must satisfy <m>\beta^2 \bar{a} = w = \beta \bar{b}</m>,
                so the only choice is <m>\bar{b} \rightarrow y</m>. Our 
                <m>\bar{c}</m> must satisfy 
                <m>\beta^3 \bar{a} = x = \beta \bar{c}</m>, so the only choice 
                is <m>\bar{c} \rightarrow w</m>.  Once again, our choice of 
                <m>\bar{d}</m> is still independent with two options of <m>m,l</m>.
                These two maps,
                <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow z, \bar{b} \rightarrow y, 
                    \bar{c} \rightarrow w, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]</m> and
                    <m>[\bar{a} \rightarrow z, \bar{b} \rightarrow y, 
                        \bar{c} \rightarrow w, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]</m>,
                bring our running total to 12.

            <p>
                And.... this is where I got stuck. I mean, <em>really</em> stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
                After going through this algorithm 3 times and getting the same
                12 maps, I decided to double check my work using Python.  Both my 
                implementation of the described algorithm and my exhaustive search
                both only found the same 12 maps seen here.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Once I kind of a way of quickly testing arbitrary maps for
                structure preservation, I was able to speed up my testing of 
                different hypotheses about where my missing two maps could be.
                After several hours of unsuccessfully scouring the Internets for answers, 
                I decided it was time for a break and cracked open a beer.

                Yeah, I know that's not what you'd expect the solution to 
                a math problem to be.  But that's precisely what <em>I</em>
                needed at the time.

                That beer was to my hand what the pillow was to Alphonse in 
                Last week's <em>#Caturday</em> post:

            <p>
                I think that I was so wrapped up in my own version of the 
                problem. I wasn't actually reading <em>what  
                the authors said</em>.  The text does not state
                there are 14 maps, it was just "heavily implied". 
            </p>
            <p>
                This question is starting to feel self-referential in a 
                way I hadn't been expecting. My current line of thinking
                is authors' use of the pronoun "I" instead of "we" here is 
                done with intention, and that my two missing maps are somehow 
                related to the way the "null map" and the "identity map" were
                handled in the bookkeeping rules of the broader category.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think I'm 
                going to let this stew for while to see if I
                can come up with a better solution that answers this and 
                Exercise 9 simultaneously.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Stay tuned.
