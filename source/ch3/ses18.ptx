    <title>Session 18: Review of Test 2</title>
    <p>
        Happy New Year! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked Test 2 out on paper first, but I simply 
        couldn't resist the looking at the review.  I 
        think I'm going to keep that separate for now,
        but have an idea of what I want to do with it.
        Stay tuned.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am, however, going to do a self-reflection on Test 2 
        in a problem block below.  I always told my students
        how it's an important part of the learning process,
        so it's only fair I practice it myself.

        <title>Test 2, Problem (1)</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
           ...fixed point...
            </p>
   
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                I think my solution is "close enough" to Danilo's,
                but I did leave out the parentheses where I thought
                they were obvious.  A picky professor might ding me
                on that I suppose. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To include or not to include? It's hard to write 
                math not knowing who the target audience 
                is sometimes.   Assuming the associative property
                implies that the parentheses don't matter, but
                putting the explicit parentheses in makes the
                substitution a little clearer.

        <title>Test 2, Problem (3)</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find an example...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                I think I made the same "mistake" as Katie did 
                here and should have explicitly tested every point.
                Calling out that everyone's diagram looked the same
                was a nice touch too.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The natural sequence of diagrams here was very 
                interesting, and reminds me of some of the diagram
                sequences I drew in Session 16 <mdash/> 
                only backwards. 
            </p>

        <title>Test 2, Problem (2)</title>
        
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find all maps...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                On the bright side, I found the correct number of
                of maps and I know at 3 out of my 4 maps are correct.
                Had I not spent a whole month on Session 15, I probably
                wouldn't have found the fourth, so it's nice to have 
                some validation that I'm on the right track.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Had this been an actual test, I probably would
                have tripped up on this one and run out of time.
                I worked through a page and a half before I realized
                I had confused "irreflexive graphs" with 
                "reflexive graphs".  Furthermore, my approach of 
                proving that <m>s' f_A = f_D s</m> and <m>t' f_A = f_D t</m>
                through "giant tables" isn't a very test-friendly strategy.                
            </p>
