    <title>Summary/Quiz on Opposed Maps</title>
    <p>
      After reading over the <em>How to solve the quiz problems</em> section, I think I was
      mostly on track.  A "fussy professor" might have taken issue with me, but since I worked
      through these last two sections on crowded 8-hour flights I deserve to cut myself a little
      slack.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The authors included one more "quiz" before the "test" and I think I'm about ready for it.
      It seemed like the answers to this quiz were meant as more of a study-guide than anything 
      else.  
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Problem 1</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given two maps...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I went with <em>always</em> and <em>endomap</em>.  As long as the domain and
          codomain of the maps match up, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to
          compose them. Once we do compose them, the resulting maps have the property
          that the codomain and domain are the same: <m>A \xrightarrow{g \circ f} A</m>
          and <m>B \xrightarrow{f \circ g} B</m>.  This definition was repeated just a few
          pages prior.
        </p>
      </solution>

    </example>
    <example>
      <title>Problem 2</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we know that <m>g</m>...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I went with <em><m>1_A</m></em>, <em>endomap</em>, <em>idempotent</em>, and
          <em><m>(g \circ f) \circ (g \circ f) = g \circ f</m></em>.
          I don't know how many times I referred back to Article II for the definitions
          of retraction and section on page 49 but I think it's finally starting to sink in. 
          The notion that "only <em>endomaps</em> have a chance to be <em>idempotent</em>"
          was emphasized in the quiz solution to 2(a). 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>Problem 3</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we even know that <m>f</m>...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I went with <em><m>1_B</m></em> and <em><m>g</m></em>.  One of the 
          big results from Article II Exercise 2 was that if an inverse map exists
          then it must be unique.  Stating that <m>f</m> is an <em>isomorphism</em>
          is equivalent to saying that the section and retraction are uniquely defined
          by the inverse <m>f^{-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>Problem 4</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Going back to 0...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I chose <em>could be different from</em> in both cases.  In the "Composition
          of opposed maps" on the previous page they use the maps <m>g = mother</m>
          and <m>f = father</m> as an example.  With those definitions, <m>f \circ g \circ f(me)</m>
          would be "the father of my paternal grandmother" which is clearly a different person
          than "my father" <m>f(me)</m> so <m>f \circ g \circ f \neq f</m>.  Likewise, the
          map <m>f \circ g</m> would be like a relation of "maternal grandfather".  Clearly
          the "maternal grandfather of my maternal grandfather" described by <m>f \circ g \circ f \circ g(me)</m>
          would be a different person than "my maternal grandfather" <m>f \circ g(me)</m>. 
          Since we only need one counter-example to prove maps different, <em>QED</em>.
