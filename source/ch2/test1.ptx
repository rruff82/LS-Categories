    <title>Test 1</title>
    <p>
      This week I worked through Test 1, and honestly, it wasn't half as hard as I remembered it being the first time
      I attempted it.  I even managed to dig out my original attempt for comparison and I'm much more confident in my 
      new solutions than the old ones.  Even though it was easier than expected, I feel uneasy about sharing "test 
      solutions" too widely.  I do think it's fair to reflect on the mistake I made though.

          What I learned from comparing my attempts.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I think the first time I attempted this I made a mistake in problem 1(b).  Looking over my notes,
          it seems like I was still confused about the definition of <em>idempotent</em>.  Rather than
          coming up with a endomap <m>e</m> that satisfied <m>e \circ e = e</m>, I seem to have constructed one 
          where <m>e \circ e = 1_A</m>.  As a result of using an <em>involution</em> instead, I was justifiably 
          having a hard time showing the properties in part (c).  This defintion actually appears on the page
          adjacent to the test with a note to "see Article III", so I'd expect that this was a common mistake made 
          by students while in development.

      I really would like some feedback on my test solutions anyway.  Just as a sanity check for myself.  If
      you're an experienced enough mathematician to look over it, connect with me on Mathstodon and I'd be happy 
      to direct message you a link! I even figured out how to add raster images this week so it includes a bonus 
      cat pic!
