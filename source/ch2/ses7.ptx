    <title>Session 7: Isomorphisms and coordinates</title>
    <p>
      It turns out that last week's lack of exercises wasn't as much of an anomaly as I thought it was.
      After realizing that this week's session didn't have any exercises either, I scanned ahead and 
      noticed that there are several sessions like this before eventually reaching a "Quiz" and "Test".
      I'm not sure how I plan to handle those yet, but I think I'm going to keep with my chill pace for
      now.  This session did include several side questions throughout that I can treat as I would the
      exercises.

    <example>
      <title>Aside 1</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What, approximately, is <m>coordinate(x)</m> for the point <m>x</m> in the picture?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I took a modern approach and used technology to provide a more accurate estimation.  
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              I began by holding the page as flat as I could while taking a photo with my phone 
              and uploaded to the cloud.  
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I downloaded this photo from my PC and opened it in <url href="http://gimp.org">GIMP</url>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I used the cursor to identify the following coordinates in pixels:
               <m>r = plot(-4.3) = (897,2904)</m>, <m>x = (1370,2926)</m>, <m>p = plot(0) = (1689,2937)</m>,
               <m>q = plot(3.5) = (2453,2970)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Next I calculated the distances from <m>r</m> to <m>q</m> and from <m>p</m> to <m>x</m>.
              Specifically, <m>||q-r|| \approx 1557.4</m> and <m>||p-x|| \approx 319.19</m>. 
            </p>                
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              With this information in hand, I can set up a ratio to determine <m>x</m>. 
              Solving <m>\frac{3.5-(-4.3)}{0-x} \approx -\frac{1557.4}{319.19}</m> results in 
              a solution of <m>x \approx -1.5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This seems like a reasonable estimate based on the diagram.
        </p>

      <title>Aside 2</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What are the choice of origin, positive direction, and unit of 'distance' involved in
          specifying this isomorphism?...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Oooh this is a fun one! Let's presume we meet some alien species and are trying to sync up
          our timelines.  We're going to need both space and time coordinates if we really want to do
          this right.  One possibility is for both parties to use "the big bang" as a point of origin
          and "the light cone" for a direction and magnitude.  This choice makes converting easy, but
          potentially imprecise because of the sheer size of those values. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A much more practical approach would be to use the meeting time and location as a point of
          origin, use physical constants to communicate SI units, then work backwards to calculate the
          local time for each party using a Lorentz transformation.  We'd just need to where they came 
          from and how fast they traveled to convert their home civilization's time to their current 
          time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the point that the authors were trying to communicate was that our choice of units 
          and magnitude for "time" are very specific to our origin on planet Earth.  If we're talking 
          about units of "years" as being "one orbit around the Sun" and the origin as a socially defined
          "common era", then an alien race from another plant would likely have totally different system
          of dating then us.  However, most SI units are based on physical properties of our universe.
          Even if this species chose a different set of base units than us, we could match up measurements
          of certain elements to develop an <em>isomorphism</em> between our two systems.

          The first thing that jumps out at me about the bracket is that the sums of 
          the adjacent ranks are constant:

        In other words, the best player is alway paired with the worst player, the next best with the next 
        worst, and so on until all pairs have been assigned.  However, the fun doesn't stop there.

      <p>
        The bracket also appears to balance "skill gap" between the top half and the bottom half.  The 
        winner of the match-up with the highest rank differential goes on to face the winner of the match
        with the lowest differential in the next round.  Those differentials sum to a constant much like 
        the ranks did.

        Between those two conditions, that should be enough to determine the 4 and 16 
        player brackets.  The four player one is easy, since it's essentially embeeded 
        in the original.

          To make the 16 player bracket, I'm going to start by pairing off players based on rank:
          The player in rank 1 should be paired with the player in rank 16, rank 2 with rank 15, 
          rank 3 with rank 14, and so on until all 8 pairs have been assigned.  Since these pairings
          go from largest score differential to smallest, we can assign the pairs to each of the "ranks" 
          in the 8 player bracket to extend it further.

          This works out nicely because if the top 8 players all win their match-ups in
          the first round of the 16-player bracket, they'd wind up in a bracket that is 
          basically identical to their placement in the 8-player bracket. Likewise, if 
          the top four players continue to win then we end up in a situation identical to
          the 4-player bracket. It has a nice recursively defined structure.
