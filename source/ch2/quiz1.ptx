    <title>Quiz</title>
    <p>
      Since the following section is entitled "How to solve the quiz problems", I'm interpreting
      that as a sign that answering these problems publicly like this is acceptable use.  My time
      as a teacher has taught me that the primary distinction betweeen formatitve and summative
      assessments lies in how you use them, and this quiz seems to be treated like the former.  The
      goal is to provide students with a self-check on important concepts before the first "test".
    </p>
    <p>
      As I'm still trying to force myself to slow down, my plan for time being is to take the
      quiz this week and self-grade my own work next week before attempting the "test" the week after.
      I feel as though posting test solutions online would be poor form, so I think I'm going to
      put my test solutions in a separate PretextBook that can be shared on a per person basis to
      anyone that's willing to help determine the correctness of my work.  We'll see how that goes in
      the future, but for now we focus on the problems at hand.
    </p>

      <title>Problem 1</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give an example of two explicit sets...

          I know this may be a little regressive of me, but I found it easier to think of this problems
          in terms of "onto" and "one-to-one".  Since I'm looking for a map that "has a section but not
          a retraction", that effectively means the map is "one-to-one but not onto".  My insticts about
          functions tell me that this occurs when my "output space" is bigger than my "input space".
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the sets <m>A = \set{a}</m> and <m>B = \set{b,c}</m>, and define <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B</m>
          by the following internal diagram:

            To demonstrate that this map has the required properties, let's start by identifying the
            retraction <m>B \xrightarrow{r} A</m>:

        <p>
          Proving this is a retraction requires that we show <m>r \circ f = 1_A</m>.  Fortunately
          this proof is trivial since there's only one element in <m>A</m> for us to test. Since
          <m>a</m> is the only possible input, the fact that <m>(r \circ f)(a) = r(f(a)) = r(b) = a</m>
          is sufficient to satisfy the condition <m>r \circ f = 1_A</m>.  Thus, <m>r</m> is a
          retraction of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this map <m>r</m> does not function as a section because <m>(f \circ r) \neq 1_B</m>.
          This can be easily observed by applying the composition <m>f \circ r</m> to point <m>c</m>:
          <m>(f \circ r)(c) = f(r(c)) = f(a) = b \neq c</m>.  In order for a map to be a section of <m>f</m>,
          it needs to send point <m>c</m> to something other than <m>b</m>, but there isn't anywhere else for
          it to go!

          Since we lose an element when mapping from <m>B \longrightarrow A</m>, there's no way to
          reconstruct it afterwards. It follows that <m>f</m> cannot possibly have a section <m>s</m>
          satisfying <m>f \circ s = 1_B</m>. This completes the proof that <m>f</m> satistfies the
          desired properties.

          Recall that a map <m>e</m> is "idempotent" if <m>e \circ e = e</m>. Thus, we'll take the maps
          defined in (a) and (b) and see how they might be simplified after being applied twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with (a): <m>p \circ q</m>.  Composing this map with itself gives us
          <m>(p \circ q) \circ (p \circ q)</m>, which can be simplified using the associative property:
        </p>
        <me>(p \circ q) \circ (p \circ q) = p \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
        <me> = (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q</me>
        <me> = p \circ q</me>
        <p>
          Having demonstrated that <m>(p \circ q) \circ (p \circ q) = (p \circ q)</m>, we can safely
          conlude that the map in part (a) is idempotent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can apply the same strategy in (b) with the expression <m>q \circ p</m>:
        </p>
        <me>(q \circ p) \circ (q \circ p) = q \circ p \circ q \circ p</me>
        <me>= q \circ (p \circ q \circ p)</me>
        <me> = q \circ p</me>
        <p>
          Since <m>(q \circ p) \circ (q \circ p) = q \circ p</m>, we can conclude that the map in (b)
          is idempotent as well.

          ...use the given maps <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> to devise a map <m>q'</m> satisfying both...

      <solution>
        <p>
          My gut instict tells me <m>q' = q \circ p \circ q</m> because that's the simpliest map I can
          construct that will have the requisite domain and codomain. Let's check to see if it has the
          desired properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we'll look at (a) by seeing if <m>p \circ q' \circ p = p</m>.  Using only the associative
          property, we can simplify the left hand side as follows:
        </p>
        <me>p \circ q' \circ p = p \circ (q \circ p \circ q) \circ p</me>
        <me>= p \circ q \circ p \circ q \circ p</me>
        <me>= (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q \circ p</me>
        <me>= p \circ q \circ p = p</me>
        <p>
          That confirms property (a).  We can use a similar method to demonstrate property (b):
          <m>q' \circ p \circ q' = q'</m>.
        </p>
        <me>q' \circ p \circ q' = (q \circ p \circ q) \circ p \circ (q \circ p \circ q)</me>
        <me> = q \circ p \circ q \circ p \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
        <me> = q \circ (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
        <me> = q \circ p \circ q \circ p \circ q</me>
        <me> = q \circ (p \circ q \circ p) \circ q</me>
        <me> = q \circ p \circ q = q'</me>
        <p>
          Thus, our choice of <m>q'</m> has both of the required properties.

          Upon reading this problem, it sounded very similar to one of the situations in the "zoo"
          from Session 4.  Specifically, I was thinking of the map in Exercise 3 Item (c) where
          <m>\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}</m> is given by <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
          On closer inspection, my notes from that section indicate that this <m>f</m> had
          a section but no retraction -- which is the reverse of what I'm looking for here. I played
          around with item (a) from the zoo for a bit, but I wasn't quite happy with how the
          domains and codomains weren't aligning.  This got me thinking about a clue at the end of
          Session 9.  Specifically, the authors mention "Georg Cantor" by name.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the realization that I could use infinite sets of varying sizes, I decided that I could
          combine this notion with the ideas behind the set sizes in Problem 1 by making a map from a
          "countably infinite set" to an "uncountably infinite set".  In this situation, I could theoretically
          use Cantor's diagonalization argument to prove the non-existance of my section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to use a "binary representation" map <m>\mathbb{Z}^+ \xrightarrow{f} (0,1)</m> that
          takes each positive integer and turns it into a binary representation of a real number
          between 0 and 1 by prepending "0." to the reversed binary representation of the integer.  Like so:

        We can construct a map <m>(0,1) \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb{Z}^+</m> that iterates along the digits of
        the input and sums up the product of that digit with the respective powers of 2.  For example,
        <m>g(0.01001)</m> could be evaluated as follows:
      </p>
      <me>g(0.01001) = 0 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^1 +  0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^4</me>
      <me>= 2^1 + 2^4 + 2^6 = 2 + 16 + 64 = 82</me>
      <p>
        Assuming we started with some positive integer and applied <m>f</m> to it, it would be in the
        table above and this map <m>g</m> will return the number we started with.  Thus we have a well
        defined retraction becaues <m>g \circ f = 1_{\mathbb{Z}^+}</m>.  However, Cantor's diagonal argument
        suggest that there still exists at least one real number in the interval (0,1) for which there is no
        inverse.  Consider the real number constructed by taking a single "bit" from each line of the table
        following the diagonal and flipping it while adding trailing zeroes to the right as needed:

        By concatenating all these flipped bits together we can constuct a number <m>y \in (0,1)</m> given by the
        binary expansion "0.0011..." as defined above. This number doesn't have a corresponding <m>x</m> value in
        the table for <m>f</m> because it differs from every output by at least one bit.  Since <m>g(y)</m> is
        undefined, we have <m>f \circ g \neq 1_{(0,1)}</m>.  The uniqueness of the inverses we proved in Article 2
        implies that the section couldn't be anything other than the retraction <m>g</m>, so we must conlude that
        <m>f</m> does not have section.
