    <title>Session 22: Universal mapping properties, Incidence Relations, Part 3</title>
    <p>
        I think I'm going to start off on the second exercise
        this week so that I can keep moving forward.  Maybe this 
        will afford me some time to look at Session 15.

    <example>
        <title>Exercise 2:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                <p>
                    What is a figure of shape...
                </p>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Our given shape is defined as
                <m>A_2 = \boxed{\bullet \rightarrow \bullet \rightarrow \bullet}</m>.
                We have collect of <q>three dots</q> which I'll
                name <m>D_3 = \{d_0,d_1,d_2\}</m> with 
                <m>\forall i: s d_i = t d_i = d_i</m> and <q>two arrows</q>
                <m>\{a_0,a_1\}</m>
                which I'll name <m>a_0</m> such that <m>s a_0 = d_0</m> 
                and <m> t a_0 = d_1</m>,
                and <m>a_2</m> such that <m>s a_2 = d_1</m> 
                and <m> t a_2 = d_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are <q>3 choose 2 = 3</q> ways that two of our
                three dots could overlap.  In the case where 
                <m>d_0 = d_1</m>,it produces the shape
                <m>\boxed{\circlearrowleft \bullet \rightarrow \bullet}</m>,
                for <m>d_1 = d_2</m> it produces 
                <m>\boxed{\bullet \rightarrow \bullet \circlearrowright}</m>,
                and for <m>d_0 = d_2</m> it produces the shape 
                <m>\boxed{\bullet \mathrel{\substack{\rightarrow \\ \leftarrow}} \bullet} </m>.
            
                There's precisely one way all three dots could overlap
                such that <m>d_0 = d_1 = d_2</m>
                which has shape <m>\boxed{\circlearrowleft \bullet \circlearrowright}</m>.
                This last option admits one additional way of being singular,
                and that is when <m>a_0 = a_1</m>, this produces
                the final shape <m>\boxed{\bullet \circlearrowright}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since these are both endomaps, we know
                there's a isomorphism betweeen dots and arrows.
                For every <m>x_i \in X</m> there's a unique
                arrow <m>a_i</m> originating at the respective dot,
                and similarly an arrow <m>b_j</m> for each <m>y_j \in Y</m>.
                What varies from dot to dot are the number 
                of arrows with that dot as a target.  During 
                <xref ref="session15-p5">Session 15 (Part 5)</xref> 
                I was referring to
                a map I called <q>incoming arrow count</q>, 
                which I think might connected to this notion
                of <q>incidence</q>, but at the time I was focused 
                more on dots than arrows so maybe something will
                reveal itself by looking at them as arrows instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also wondering if this object <m>A_2</m> that
                was introduced here is related to what I've been calling
                <q>tails</q>.  If I take <m>A_0</m> to be the
                <q>naked dot</q> and <m>A_1</m> to be the naked arrow,
                then I can use <m>A_n</m> to represent arbitrarily long
                distances to a terminal object.  This might give me a
                more objective way of defining the map I previously 
                called <q>number of steps to stabilize</q>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of terminal objects, I've been thinking that
                my answer to Article 4 Exercise 4 might be incorrect.
                My assumption that <m>Y = \mathbf{1}</m> misses the fact
                that any n-cycle <m>C_n</m> is potentially a terminal object
                in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>.  
                I think the distinction that I failed to make was that 
                <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> aren't necessarily the same map,
                they just need to have <em>inverses</em> because
                there exactly one arrow leading into and out of
                each point. Perhaps the terminal object in
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m> 
                could be defined diectly as some factor of the identity map.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The other thing that I've been curious about was 
                Article 4 Exercise 6.  What if the special property
                of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> being hinted at here was really
                the uniqueness of prime factorizations?  Given any
                number <m>n</m>, there's a unique representation
                <m>n = p_1^{q_1} \times p_2^{q_2} \times ... \times p_n^{q_n}</m>
                where <m>p_i</m> are the prime numbers and <m>q_j \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
                This would explain our little side venture to
                prove <m>C_24 \rightarrow C_8 \times C_3</m> in 
                <xref ref="session21">Session 21 (Part 1)</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
                After playing around with this a bit in 
                <url href="https://github.com/rruff82/LS-Categories/blob/main/assets/notebooks/ls-ses22.ipynb">
                 Python</url>, I have a couple of observations.
                First, I noticed that my <q>incoming arrow counts</q>
                is essentially <q>G.degree(N)-1</q> and I think this
                <em>off-by-one error</em> might be related to why I 
                was short maps in Session 15.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The other thing I started thinking about is the 
                choice of notation.  I began wondering if the
                words choice of <q>arrow</q>, <q>binary</q>, 
                <q>cycle</q>, and <q>dot</q> has a double
                meaning when interpreted as the sequence of maps 
                <m>A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D</m>.
                If <m>I,T</m> are the initial and terminal objects
                in the category, any map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m>
                corresponds to analagous sequence 
                <m>I \rightarrow X \xrightarrow{f} Y \rightarrow T</m>
                by treating the self-referenced arrow <m>A</m> as the 
                initial object <m>I</m> and naked dot <m>D</m> as
                the terminal object <m>T</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also seemed weird how the 
                authors introduce the <q>heavy arrow</q> to 
                represent <q>epimorphism</q> then proceed to
                not use it again for the rest of the session.
                If the naming of objects <m>A,B,C,D</m> has a 
                double meaning, then maybe the choice of
                <m>r,s,t</m> are important also.  Perhaps
                the maps defined by <q>retraction</q>,
                <q>source</q>, and <q>target</q> can be 
                defined by sasifying the associative 
                property on the sequence of maps
                <m>I \xrightarrow{r} X \xrightarrow{s} Y \xrightarrow{t} T</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also found myself finding interesting properties
                of the maps 
                <m>\mathbb{N} \rightleftarrows \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}</m>.
                I think I'm starting to understand the relevance
                of defining incidence relations.  By <q>stepping out</q>
                through mapping <m>\langle s,t \rangle \rightarrow n_1</m>  and 
                <m>\langle t,s \rangle \rightarrow n_2</m> we can
                use the unique <m>\mathcal{S}</m>-map
                <m>\{n_1\} \times \{n_2\} \rightarrow \{n\}</m>
                compare whether or not <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> are
                the <q>same map</q>.  If they are, then we have a 
                terminal object in 
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\bullet \downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>.
                If they are not, then define have a new
                pair of maps <m>s',t'</m> which we can apply
                the process two a second time.

        In addition to the work here done in
        Python, I also spent some time this 
        week learning
        <url href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</url>
        through this little
        <url href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/NNG4"> 
        Natural Number Game
        </url>.  I'm still a ways away from articulating
        these exercises as proofs in Lean, but I'm starting to
        see some connections between <q><m>\leq</m> World</q>
        and the problems I'm working on here.
