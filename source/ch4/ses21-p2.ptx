    <title>Session 21: Products in categories, Part 2</title>

    <p>
        This week is going to get a little personal.  There's 
        a reason why I'm struggling with this exercise, and I
        feel like that being able to articulate precisely <q>why</q>
        it's difficult is a necessary prerequisite for me to
        progress.  
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Reflections on <sq>gender</sq></title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What's making this so difficult?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                This problem goes back to a difference in definitions
                of <q>map</q> between myself and the authors that I first 
                observed in Article I.  My model of <q>map</q> allowed for
                the output of the map to be <q>null</q> while the 
                authors' didn't.  Setting aside the merits of the 
                authors' definition for the moment, my definition of
                <q>gender map</q> has the advantage that it allows for people 
                to be non-binary in the resulting model.

            <p>
               
                In contrast, L&amp;S have defined <q>map</q>
                 in such a way that every element in the domain 
                 must have an arrow pointing to an element in 
                 the codomain.  This makes the bookkeeping of 
                 maps easier because there is a one-to-one 
                 correspondence between dots and arrows, but 
                 it does not allow for the expression of 
                 non-binary people in the same way as my model.
                 Instead, a map 
                 <m>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{G}</m> forces
                 each person into one of the two genders.

                    Essentially, by assuming that <q>if you're a 
                    person then you have a gender</q> the authors
                    have directly implied the contrapositive that 
                    <q>if you don't have a gender then you're not
                    a person</q>.  I think I might understand why 
                    they did it, but it doesn't change how messed
                    up it is to deny personhood to an entire group 
                    like that.  If the goal of this is to convince
                    me that the author's definition of map is 
                    better than the one I started with, this 
                    exercise isn't doing a very good job at it. 
                    It's starting to look more like a <q>vacuous
                    statement</q>.  Given that non-binary people
                    exist, the only logical conclusion is that the
                    map <m>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{G}</m> 
                    doesn't exist. Any conditional statement 
                    beginning with <q>if 
                    <m>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{G}</m> is a
                    map from the set of persons to genders</q> is 
                    therefore automatically true because the 
                    hypothesis is always false.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gender has been a recurring theme throughout 
                    the text so far.  We saw it in Session 5 when 
                    talking about determination problems, in 
                    <q>Composition of opposed maps</q> at the end 
                    of Part 2, in Article 3 Exercise 17, 
                    Session 12 Exercise 3, Session 15 Exercise 6,
                    and now again in Session 21 Exercise 3.  
                    Looking over my notes, we've gradually moved 
                    from looking at gender being defined as a map 
                    in <m>\mathcal{S}</m> to a map in 
                    <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright, \circlearrowleft}</m>
                    that preserves the structure of <q>father</q> 
                    and <q>mother</q> maps.  The idea here was that 
                    gender is preserved under the operations <q>father</q>
                    and <q>mother</q> because it becomes a constant map 
                    after composition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authors referred to this as <q>objectification
                    of the subjective</q>, implying that we can infer 
                    a person's gender from examining the behavior of 
                    these <q>mother</q> and <q>father</q> maps.  In 
                    Session 15, I joked that this model excluded 
                    Stormtroopers as people because as clones of a 
                    male they lack a well defined <q>mother</q> map, 
                    but the truth is that this joke was merely a 
                    reflection of the fact that this model of 
                    gender fails to work for me specifically 
                    because I don't consider myself to have a 
                    <q>father map</q>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, maybe the truth is a little more 
                    complicated. I have something like a 
                    <q>father map</q>, but it's a map from 
                    <m>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{P} \times \mathbf{P}</m>
                    rather than <m>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{P}</m> so
                    it doesn't preserve the structure of this <q>gender map</q>
                    in quite the same way.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up, there was a family legend suggesting
                    that one of my ancestors was Native American.  In
                    2020, I decided to take a DNA test to determine 
                    whether or not there was any truth to it and 
                    <url href="https://suburbanlion.com/blog/2020/11/14/land-acknowledgement/">
                    wrote about the experience on my blog</url>.  
                    What I omitted from the original post was the 
                    fact that my half-sister took the same test so 
                    we could compare results, and I inadvertently 
                    found out that I was born through a process of 
                    in vitro fertilization using donor sperm.  My 
                    parents chose to keep this secret from me until
                    such a time that I was going to find it out anyway,
                    and I'm still not exactly sure how to feel about it.  
           
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's kind of interesting that back in Session 1
                    I chose to look at a product of 
                    <m>\text{NATURE} \times \text{NURTURE}</m> 
                    because this parallels the properties of my <q>father map</q>.
                    I have a <q>nature father</q> that provided genetic material 
                    and a <q>nurture father</q> that was actually involved in my 
                    life.  Under my old definition of <q>father map</q> it would 
                    be easy for me to think of the output being <em>undefined</em>,
                    but the definitions used in the text exclude this as a 
                    possibility for the specified domain and codomain.  The fact
                    that one input corresponds to two outputs means that my 
                    <q>father map</q> does not meet the criteria for an endomap
                    on <m>\mathbf{P}</m>. The authors are using <q>gender</q> as
                    an example of a universal property, but it's not a universal 
                    property if there are people it doesn't apply to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've commented before how the sections including classroom 
                    dialogues have been fun to read, but I'm not sure if this 
                    <q>father map</q> problem is a question I'd be able to bring
                    up in class. While looking back at the <em>Composition of 
                    opposed maps</em> section for clues to this problem, the 
                    idea of being put in Alysia's shoes is terrifying.  Would 
                    I have the guts to say <q>I don't have a father map</q> in
                    a class full of strangers?  Probably not.  It's far more 
                    likely that I would lie about the personal situation in 
                    favor of a simpler mathematical model.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think what makes it even more frustrating is the fact
                    that the logical half of my brain is screaming <q>IT 
                    DOESN'T EVEN MATTER!!</q> this whole time. With the 
                    way that L&amp;S have explicitly defined the product,
                    there should still be exactly one map such that all
                    triangles commute. The universal mapping property is 
                    worded in such a way that it shouldn't matter whether
                    I have two dads or no dads <mdash/> there's still an
                    unique isomorphism between the models.  It's just 
                    easier to see without the additional complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back over Session 12 again, the authors 
                    make it very clear that the model of <q>gender</q> 
                    in Exercise 3 is completely detached from reality.
                    They explicitly state that <q>[y]ou will notice 
                    that this category contains many objects and maps
                    that cannot reasonably be interpreted as a set of 
                    people with <sq>father</sq> and <sq>mother</sq> maps</q>.
                    There's this underlying notion that even if this model 
                    of gender is <q>wrong</q>, it can still be <q>useful</q>.
                    I get that basic idea in principle, but this doesn't 
                    change how dehumanizing it feels to be excluded. How 
                    much harm are we willing to impose for the sake of 
                    utility? IVF was a relatively new procedure when the
                    first edition of this text was printed, but more recent 
                    evidence suggests that 
                    <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765402/">
                    people like myself are a rapidly 
                    growing demographic</url>. At some point mathematicians 
                    will need to stop assuming everyone comes from a 
                    traditional family structure.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is 
                    a <q>traumatic experience</q>. I probably wouldn't 
                    have even recognized it had it not been for my 
                    experiences learning about 
                    <url href="https://www.apa.org/ed/schools/primer/trauma" >
                    trauma sensitive
                    instruction</url>.  I have to constantly remind 
                    myself that I need to treat myself with grace and 
                    kindness in this situation. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Having read Eugenia Chen's <em>X+Y</em> before 
                    starting this venture through L&amp;S, I kind 
                    of expected gender to make an appearance. What 
                    I didn't expect was to start questioning my own
                    <mdash/> again.  I
                    <url href="https://suburbanlion.com/blog/2020/03/19/choosing-whiteness/" >
                    wrote before</url> about the ways in which I 
                    consciously chose to identify as male, but now 
                    there's this alternate definition where I'm not
                    so sure about the label. I have a gender map in
                    <m>\mathcal{S}</m> but not in 
                    <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright, \circlearrowleft}</m>. 
                    It's almost as if category theory has just handed me an 
                    objective definition by which I am non-binary, 
                    should I choose to accept it, and I feel a little 
                    frightened about the prospects.

                    Perhaps the big idea here is that I need to do a
                    better job of distinguishing between maps in
                    <m>\mathcal{S}</m> and maps in 
                    <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright, \circlearrowleft}</m>.
                    In Session 12, maybe they were dropping a hint when they 
                    describe a <q>person</q> who is <q>its own <sq>mother</sq>
                    and its own <sq>father</sq></q>.  Such a <sq>person</sq>
                    would satisfy the properties of a terminal object 
                    <m>T^{\circlearrowright, \circlearrowleft}</m> 
                    in the category 
                    <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright, \circlearrowleft}</m>.
                    This would at least give me an object to observe the system 
                    through.  I could enumerate all possible maps in 
                    <m>\mathcal{S}</m> and sort them into two groups based 
                    on whether or not they preserve the structure in
                    <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright, \circlearrowleft}</m>.   
                </p>
        </solution>
        
    </example>
    <p>
        That kind of took a lot out of me,  so I think I'm just
        going to sketch out some general ideas about this exercise
        and call it a week.
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Exercise 3:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Return to Exercise 3 of Session 12...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                In order for <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m> to be a 
                <em>product</em>, it must satisfy the following conditions:
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we need to show <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m> 
                is an object in 
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft, \circlearrowright}</m>, 
                and we need a pair of maps 
                <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C} \xrightarrow{p_1} \mathbf{G}</m> 
                and 
                <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C} \xrightarrow{p_2} \mathbf{C}</m>.
                Second, we need to show that for every object 
                <m>T</m> 
                and every pair of maps <m>T \xrightarrow{q_1} \mathbf{G}</m>
                and <m>T \xrightarrow{q_2} \mathbf{C}</m>, 
                there is exactly one map 
                <m>T \xrightarrow{q} \mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m>
                for which <m>q_1 = p_1 \circ q</m> and <m>q_2 = p_2 \circ q</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ignoring the wildcard object <m>T</m> for now,
                we can take all this information and construct
                an external diagram of the sitation as follows:

            <p>
                The first task was essentially the goal of Session 12 
                Exercise 3. Last time I exhaustively listed the options,
                but I think there's a more direct approach where we 
                can construct a map from the product of endomaps to 
                the endomaps of products.
            </p>
            <p>   
                Given any <m>p</m> in 
                <m>\mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowleft m_P, \circlearrowright f_P}</m>,
                and structure preserving maps
                <m>\mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowleft m_P, \circlearrowright f_P}
                    \xrightarrow{q_1} \mathbf{G}^{\circlearrowleft m_G, \circlearrowright f_G}
                </m> and <m>\mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowleft m_P, \circlearrowright f_P}
                    \xrightarrow{q_2} \mathbf{C}^{\circlearrowleft m_C, \circlearrowright f_C}
                </m>,
                we can define a map 
                <m>\mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowleft m_P, \circlearrowright f_P} 
                    \xrightarrow{q} (\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C})^{\circlearrowleft m_{G \times C}, \circlearrowright f_{G \times C}}</m>
                 such that 
                <m>m_{G \times C} \circ q \circ p 
                    = \langle m_G \circ q_1 \circ p, m_C \circ q_2 \circ p \rangle
                    = \langle q_1 \circ m_P \circ p, q_2 \circ f_P \circ p \rangle
                </m>
                and 
                <m>f_{G \times C} \circ q \circ p 
                    = \langle f_G \circ q_1 \circ p, f_C \circ q_2 \circ p \rangle
                    = \langle q_1 \circ f_P \circ p, q_2 \circ f_P \circ p \rangle</m>.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>\mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowleft m_P, \circlearrowright f_P}
                    \xrightarrow{q_1} \mathbf{G}^{\circlearrowleft m_G, \circlearrowright f_G}
                </m> needs to preserve the structure of <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft \circlearrowright}</m>,
                we must have the property that <m>q_1 m_P = m_G q_1</m> and
                <m>q_1 f_P = f_G q_1</m>.  Likewise, <m>\mathbf{P}^{\circlearrowleft m_P, \circlearrowright f_P}
                    \xrightarrow{q_2} \mathbf{C}^{\circlearrowleft m_C, \circlearrowright f_C}
                </m> must preserve <m>q_2 \circ m_P = m_C \circ q_2</m> and 
                <m>q_2 \circ f_P = f_C \circ q_2</m>.  By substituting into our definition
                of <m>q</m>, we get the following:
            </p>
            <me>m_{G \times C} \circ q \circ p = \langle m_G \circ q_1 \circ p, m_C \circ q_2 \circ p \rangle</me>
            <me> = \langle q_1 \circ m_P \circ p, q_2 \circ m_P \circ p \rangle = q m_P p</me>
            <me>f_{G \times C} \circ q \circ p = \langle f_G \circ q_1 \circ p, f_C \circ q_2 \circ p \rangle</me>.        
            <me> = \langle q_1 \circ f_P \circ p, q_2 \circ f_C \circ p \rangle = q f_P p</me>
            <p>
                Since this is true for any <m>p</m>, we can equate the maps
                <m>m_{G \times C} \circ q = q \circ m_P</m>
                and <m>f_{G \times C} \circ q = q \circ f_P</m>.  This demonstrates
                that <m>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m> is a valid
                map in the category. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, let's have a look at our projection maps
                <m>p_1,p_2</m> defined by <m>p_1 \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = x_1</m>
                and <m>p_2 \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = x_2</m>. 
                For any person <m>p</m>,
                we'd defined
                <m>q \circ p = \langle q_1 p, q_2 p\rangle</m>.
                Applying our projection maps <m>p_1, p_2</m> on the
                left gives us <m>p_1 \circ q \circ p = q_1 p</m>
                and <m>p_2 \circ q \circ p = q_2 p</m>. This gives us
                the properties that <m>q_1 = p_1 \circ q</m>
                and <m>q_2 = p_2 \circ q</m>.  
                I should probably point out that 
                the necessary structure preservation properties 
                <m>m_G \circ p_1 = p_1 \circ m_{G \times C}</m>,
                <m>f_G \circ p_1 = p_1 \circ f_{G \times C}</m>, 
                <m>m_C \circ p_2 = p_2 \circ m_{G \times C}</m>, and
                <m>f_C \circ p_2 = p_2 \circ f_{G \times C}</m>, all follow directly 
                from our choice of <m>m_{G \times C} = m_G \times m_C</m> 
                and <m>f_{G \times C} = f_G \times f_C</m>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                I think it might also be helpful to reproduce the diagrams 
                from Session 12 in the style used by this Session:

            <p>
                Since there's only one point in the set, any point 
                mapped to <m>\mathbf{T}</m> must map everything to 
                the only point.  
                Since both endomaps are the identity map on this point,
                each endomap from the source space must get mapped to the 
                identity in order to preserve structure.  Having a
                terminal object allows us to 
                define a set of 5 unique maps:
                 <me>\mathbf{T} \rightarrow \mathbf{T}</me>
                 <me>\mathbf{P} \rightarrow \mathbf{T}</me>
                 <me>\mathbf{G} \rightarrow \mathbf{T}</me>
                 <me>\mathbf{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{T}</me>
                 <me>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{T}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                I think one of the important features of this object
                is that it can't be mapped back to any of elements 
                in <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m>.  There's are 4 maps from
                <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m>,
                but none of them preserve the structure of
                <m>\mathbf{T}^{\circlearrowleft m_T,\circlearrowright f_T}</m> 
                because <m>m_{G \times C},f_{G \times C}</m> are different maps
                while <m>m_T = f_T</m> for the only element in <m>\mathbf{T}</m>.
                There's a unique set of isomorphism in <m>\mathcal{S}</m> given by
                <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longleftarrow}} \mathbf{T}</m>,
                <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longleftarrow}} \mathbf{G}</m>, 
                <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longleftarrow}} \mathbf{C}</m>,
                <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longleftarrow}} \mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m>, 
                and 
                <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longleftarrow}} \mathbf{P}</m>.
                However, none of the composite maps <m>\mathcal{S}</m>-maps 
                <m>\mathbf{T} \rightarrow \mathbf{G}</m>, <m>\mathbf{T} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}</m>,
                <m>\mathbf{T} \rightarrow \mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m>
                preserve the structure required of maps in
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft, \circlearrowright}</m> because
                there's two unique maps in the codomain and only one in 
                the domain. This seems like a reasonable way to say our product
                uniquely commutes, which is what we needed to complete the proof.

                I've been trying to avoid using the sum here, but I think this
                relation is nicely summarized by the following diagram:

                Once we start looking at the maps from 
                <m>\mathbf{4} \rightarrow \mathbf{4}</m> 
                which are invertable, the number of ways of
                breaking them into pairs is limited. One of
                the things I noticed while exploring was that
                if I defined a <q>parent of opposite gender</q>
                map <m>\mathbf{P} \xrightarrow{\alpha} \mathbf{P}</m>,
                composing this map with <m>q</m> to get 
                <m>\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{C}</m> into
                a cycle of length 4 under the respective operation 
                <m>\alpha'</m>.  
            </p>
            <me>
                \alpha' \text{he-wolf} = \text{she-wolf}

            <me>
                \alpha' \text{she-wolf} = \text{he-bear}
            </me>
            <me>
                \alpha' \text{he-bear} = \text{she-bear}
            </me>
            <me>
                \alpha' \text{she-bear} = \text{he-wolf}
            </me>
        
            <p>
                Some further investigation into the maps 
                <m>m_{G \times C}, f_{G \times C}</m> revealed 
                other interesting patterns as well.  For example,
                I found we have the following relations:
                <me>m_{G \times C} \circ m_{G \times C} = m_{G \times C}</me>
                <me>f_{G \times C} \circ m_{G \times C} = f_{G \times C}</me>
                <me>m_{G \times C} \circ m_{G \times C} \circ m_{G \times C} = m_{G \times C}</me>
                <me>f_{G \times C} \circ f_{G \times C} \circ f_{G \times C} = f_{G \times C}</me> 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The structure of these relations reminded me of the 
                presentations of dynamical systems we say is Session 15.
                In particular, it got me thinking about the way I was trying 
                to standardize my presentations using an isomorphism
                <m>\mathbb{N} \leftrightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}</m>.
                In particular, there were two different ways of enumerating
                my table of
                <m>\langle \text{generator}, \text{iterations} \rangle</m>
                pairs:

                These two methods both enumerate all possible 
                values, but the do so in a slightly different order.
                When the ordered pairs all commute, such that
                <m>\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = \langle x_2, x_1 \rangle</m>,
                then the two representations converge to a single solution.
                Perhaps this is why the phrase <q>all triangles commute</q> 
                does such heavy lifting.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't help but wonder if the point of this whole 
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowleft,\circlearrowright}</m>
                category is to generalize from my <em>zig-zag</em> ordering
                of elements into two separate operators <mdash/> such that
                <m>m</m> increments the row and <m>f</m> increments the column.
                Even two observers have different enumeration maps, each 
                map will have a unique pair of <m>m,f</m> maps such that 
                they both agree every value in the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think I've fully answered this exercise
                quite yet, but at least I'll have some better notes 
                for next time this model shows up.
