    <title>Session 19: Terminal objects</title>

    <p>
        It's actually quite refreshing to not have any exercises
        this week.  Well, there kind of is <em>an</em> exercise
        described but it's such a trivial solution that even I'm 
        going to leave it to the reader and give my brain a break.  
        I think my reading this week confirms I'm on the right 
        track, but I need to be more precise with my statements
        about <q>precisely one map</q> moving forward.
