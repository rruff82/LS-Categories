                I don't know if this will become relevant, but I've
                got this overwhelming urge to complete the diagram
                above this problem:

            <p>
                My intuition suggests that the existence of a
                retraction like <m>r</m> in the diagram depends
                whether or not <m>Y \subset X</m>.
                I think that's conceptually related to the <q>dual</q> 
                of this exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think there's also an implication that the result
                I'm looking for follows from
                the <q>universal property of products</q>.  This was defined 
                over a (possibly empty) set of indices <m>I</m> where each
                <m>i</m> in <m>I</m> defines a (possibly duplicated) object
                <m>C_i</m> in the category <m>\mathcal{C}</m>.
            </p>
            <definition xml:id="def-product-universal">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        A <term>product</term> is an object <m>P</m>
                        together with maps <m>P \xrightarrow{p_1} C_i</m>
                        (one for each <m>i</m>), having the universal property:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given any object <m>X</m> and any maps <m>X \xrightarrow{f_i} C_i</m>
                        (one for each <m>i</m>), there is exactly one map
                        <m>X \xrightarrow{p} P</m> such that <m>p_i p = f_i</m>
                        for each <m>i</m> in <m>I</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
            <p>
                In this hypothetical category <m>\mathcal{C}</m> with 
                initial object <m>S</m> and terminal object <m>T</m>,
                there should be unique maps <m>\alpha,\beta</m> where 
                <m>S \xrightarrow{\alpha} X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xrightarrow{\beta} T</m>
                satisfy the associative property.  Let's start
                enumerating these objects <m>C_i</m> of our category:
                <m>C_0 = S</m>, <m>C_1 = X</m>, <m>C_2 = Y</m>, 
                <m>C_3 = T</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the universalized definition of product, 
                for any <m>X</m> there should be
                a unique object <m>P</m> and map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} P</m>,
                and maps <m>P \xrightarrow{p_i} C_i</m> for each <m>i</m>
                such that <m>p_i f = f_i</m> for every <m>X \xrightarrow{f_i} C_I</m>.  
                Since this product is also an object in the category,
                let's call it <m>C_4 = S \times X \times Y \times T</m>.  What if we just need to 
                iterate over all of these <m>C_i</m> to handle the cases
                where <m>X = Y</m> and <m>X \neq Y</m> at the same time?
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's start with <m>X = C_0 = S</m>.  Any map <m>X \xrightarrow{f_0} C_0</m>
                would have to the unique map <m>S \xrightarrow{1_S} S</m>.
                Likewise, any <m>X \xrightarrow{f_1} C_1</m> would
                be the unique map <m>S \rightarrow X</m>,  
                <m>X \xrightarrow{f_2} C_2</m> would
                be the unique map <m>S \rightarrow Y</m>,  
                <m>X \xrightarrow{f_3} C_3</m> would
                be the unique map <m>S \rightarrow T</m>, 
                <m>X \xrightarrow{f_4} C_4</m> would
                be the unique map <m>S \rightarrow X \times Y</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's move on <m>X = C_1 = X</m>.  If any 
                map <m>X \xrightarrow{f_0} C_0</m> existed,
                that would imply that <m>X</m> is itself 
                an intial object.  We could then used the uniqueness
                of the inverse map <m>C_1 \rightarrow C_0</m> to uniquely define the rest 
                of the maps we're looking for through precomposition with the 
                maps we saw previously.  In fact, I think we can go one step 
                further and assume that no <m>C_i \rightarrow C_0</m> exists
                for any <m>i &gt; 0</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming that no map <m>X \rightarrow C_0</m> exists,
                then it seems reasonable to conclude that the only 
                way <m>P \xrightarrow{p_1} X</m> can satisfy <m>p_1 p = f_1</m>
                for all <m>X \xrightarrow{f_1} X</m> 
                is if <m>p_1 p = 1_X</m> for all <m>X</m>.  
                I think this partially explains the wildcard notation of
                <m>?</m> in the definition
                of <m>\Gamma = \langle ?, f \rangle</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The existence of some <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m> necessarily means 
                we have maps <m>T \xrightarrow{x_i} X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xrightarrow{\bar{y_i}} T</m>.
                I'm thinking we could have take the product <m>X\rightarrow X \times X</m>
                 that maps <m>x_i</m> to the pair <m>\langle x_i,x_i\rangle</m>.
                and then somehow compare this with 
                the projection map <m>X \rightarrow X \times Y</m> that pairs each <m>x_i</m> with the respective 
                <m>y_i = f x_i</m>.  I'm thinking we can do this by 
                <q>stepping out</q> somehow through a shared map
                <m>X \rightarrow X \times (X+Y)</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
        
    </example>

    <p>
        I'm starting to get a little lost at this point, so I think
        I'll try to spend some more time on this later.
