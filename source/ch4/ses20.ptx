    <title>Session 20: Points of an object</title>

    <p>
        Another week where there aren't any explicit exercises!  
        I really like the table in this session <mdash/>
        a well used graphic organizer.  It made me 
        wonder if my approach to Session 17 Exercise 1 was correct,
        which then got me looking over my notes from Session 11.
        I'm curious to see a better definition of the <q>free 
        category on graphs</q> makes an appearance later.
