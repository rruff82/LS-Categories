    <title>Session 28: The category of pointed sets, Part 2</title>
    
    <p>
        I think I'd like to start this time with exploring
        some simple examples of maps in <m>\mathbf{1} / \mathcal{S}</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Exercise 1:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Both parts of the distributive laws...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
    <p>
        First, we know that the initial object <m>\mathbf{0}</m>
        is <em>not</em> an empty set.  In <m>\mathbf{1} / \mathcal{S}</m>,
        we need to pair the object <m>\mathbf{0}</m> with a map
        <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{\mathbf{0}_0} \mathbf{0}</m>
        to the <q>distinguished point</q>.  Let's depict this 
        object visually as <m>\mathbf{0} = \boxed{\star}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similary, the terminal object <m>\mathbf{1}</m> is also a 
        set with a single distinguished point <m>\boxed{\star}</m>.
        Since there's only one object in <m>\mathbf{1}</m>,
        the map to this distinquished point would technically 
        the identity map <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{1_\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{1}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since <m>\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{1}</m>, the products 
        defined by <m>\mathbf{0} \times \mathbf{1}</m>,
        <m>\mathbf{1} \times \mathbf{0}</m>, 
        <m>\mathbf{0} \times \mathbf{0}</m>, and 
        <m>\mathbf{1} \times \mathbf{1}</m> would all
        need to be isomorphic to <m>\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{1}</m> 
        as depicted by the following 
        diagram:

    <p>
       Since we've defined sums in this category
       by <q>gluing together at the base point</q>,
       it also means that 
       the sums <m>\mathbf{0} + \mathbf{1}</m>,
        <m>\mathbf{1} + \mathbf{0}</m>, 
        <m>\mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0}</m>, and 
        <m>\mathbf{1} + \mathbf{1}</m> would also all
        need to be isomorphic to <m>\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{1}</m>:

    <p>
        So when happens when there's some object <m>X</m>
        in my category which is neither initial nor 
        terminal?  It seems reasonable that simpliest
        such object would be a set with both a 
        disinguished and non-distinuguished point
        such as <m>A = \boxed{\star ~ ~ \bullet}</m>.
        Since we have a unique map <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow A</m>
        by the definition of initial object, and a unique map
        <m>A \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m> by the definition of 
        terminal object, the associative property of the 
        category says that we should be able to compose 
        these maps around the unique identity map
         <m>1_A</m>.  The composition <m>
        \mathbf{0} \rightarrow A \xrightarrow{1_A} 
            A  \rightarrow \mathbf{1}
        </m> should look something like this:

        Suppose we have some other endomap 
        <m>A \xrightarrow{e} A</m>
        such that <m>e \neq 1_{A}</m>.
        Since every map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m>
        in <m>\mathbf{1} / \mathcal{S}</m>
        must preserve the structure of the 
        distinguished point such that <m>f x_0 = y_0</m>
        for the maps <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x_0} X</m>
        and <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{y_0} Y</m>.
        Since in our case <m>X = A = Y</m>, that means 
        our <m>e</m> must satisfy <m>e a_0 = a_0</m>
        for the distinguished map <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{a_0} A</m>.
        Thus, the condition that <m>e \neq 1_A</m> implies that
        the only other point in <m>A</m>, let's 
        call it <m>a_1</m>, must be mapped to 
        something other than itself, which necessarily means that
        <m>e a_1 = a_0</m>.  This map
        <m>e</m> would need to be the standard
        idempotent <m>\boxed{
            \circlearrowright \star \leftarrow \bullet}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what happens when we take the product 
        <m>\mathbf{0} \times A</m>?  Pictorally
        it should resemble the following:

        <p>
            The big question here is whether 
            or not the map <m>\mathbf{0} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbf{0} \times A</m>
            is an <q>isomorphism</q>.  By definition,
            <m>p</m> is an isomorphism if and only if there exists
            a map
            <m>\mathbf{0} \times A \xrightarrow{p^{-1}} \mathbf{0}</m>
            satisfying <m>p^{-1} p = 1_\mathbf{0}</m> and 
            <m>p p^{-1} = 1_\mathbf{0} \times A </m>.  </p> 
        <p> 
            Clearly, the projection map
            <m>\mathbf{0} \times A \xrightarrow{p_1} \mathbf{0}</m>
            satisfies the properties of a <q>section</q>. The composition
            <m>p_1 p</m> has domain and codomain 
            <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m> and would therefore
            need to be the unique map <m>1_\mathbf{0}</m>.  If 
             a retraction <m>p^{-1}</m> exists, it must be equivalent
            to the section.  Does the composition
            defined by
            <m>\mathbf{0} \times A \xrightarrow{p p_1} \mathbf{0} \times A</m>
            result in the identity map <m>1_{\mathbf{0} \times A}</m>? 

            My gut tells me no, but its not exactly clear why.
        </p>
        <p> There must exist a pair of maps 
            <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{
                \langle \star, \star \rangle \\ 
                \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\
                \langle \star, \bullet \rangle
                }} \mathbf{0} \times A</m> to the two points 
                in the product.  Post composing by 
                <m>p_2</m> would then give us a pair of maps
                to <m>A</m> defined by
                            <m>\mathbf{1} \mathrel{\substack{
                p_2 \langle \star, \star \rangle \\ 
                \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\
                p_2 \langle \star, \bullet \rangle
                }} A</m>.  However, as a maps in 
                <m>\mathbf{1} / \mathcal{S}</m>, 
                these maps must satisfy 
                both send the distinguished point
                in <m>\mathbf{1}</m> to the distinguished point
                in <m>A</m>.  This feels like a contradiction
                in terms.  
            Perhaps I'm confusing myself by referring to the 
            distinuguished objects in <m>\mathbf{0}</m>
            and <m>\mathbf{1}</m> by the same symbol?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's draw it out again, but this time 
            add the <q>sum</q> 
            <m>\mathbf{0}+\mathbf{0} \times A +A</m> into the picture as well:

                This is interesting because 
                <m>A+A</m> gets two non-distinguished
                points.  Maybe I wasn't far off when 
                I originally considered the map
                <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow \mathbf{0} \times A</m>
                to behave like <q>monoid</q>?
            What if the solution I'm really looking for 
            here is the object
            <m>A = \mathbb{N}</m>?

        <p>
            Consider this.  For any map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m>
             in <m>\mathbf{1} / \mathcal{S}</m>,
             we can think of <m>X=C_i</m> and <m>Y=C_j</m>
             for some <q>preferred</q> indexing of the objects in the category.
             If there is further some indexing of objects in <m>X</m>
             such that a map <m>\mathbb{N} \xrightarrow{p} X</m>
             enumerates the elements of <m>x</m>, we 
             can pair every point in every object with a 
             pair of indexes in 
             <m>\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}</m> such that one projection map
             points to the index of the object <m>C_i</m> in the category
             and the other returns the index <m>p</m> of a particular 
             map <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x_p} X</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes <m>\mathbb{N}</m> special here is that 
            theres a unique isomorphism 
            <m>\mathbb{N} \leftrightarrows \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}</m>
            in <m>\mathcal{S}</m>
             that we previously saw in <xref ref="session27-p4"/>.
             I also remember  the authors establishing that it does <m>not</m> preserve 
            the structure of <m>\mathbb{N}^{\circlearrowright \sigma}</m>.
        </p><p>
            
            
            Likewise, I think the same is true of the unique
            isomorphism <m>\mathbb{N} \leftrightarrows \mathbb{N}+\mathbb{N}</m>.
            Maybe we can those projections and injections
            to construct an isomporphism 
            <m>\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \leftrightarrows \mathbb{N}+\mathbb{N}</m>
            that matches up with our <q>identity matrix</q> some how?
        </p>
        <p>
            I also find it curious that the fundamental theorem 
            of arithmetic hasn't come into play yet.  It seems like
            that further gives me maps <m>\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^m</m>
            for arbitrarily large <m>m</m> by using the uniqueness 
            of the prime-factorization of numbers.  It seems like 
            would behave similarly to <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m>
            in that the objects <m>0,1</m> would require special treatment.    
        </p> 
            </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
        I'm not sure I've gotten very far on this proof yet, 
        but at least it feels like the brainstorming was productive?
