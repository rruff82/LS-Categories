    <title>Session 28: The category of pointed sets</title>
    <p>
        I think I need to start with some proof-reading of 
        the named exercises from Article IV before I attempt
        the new ones.  It's pretty clear from the reading 
        this week that my original notion of 
        <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m> was <em>way off</em>.
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Proof-reading of Article IV, Exercises: 8,9,20</title>
        
        <statement>
    <p>
        As seen in <xref ref="article4-p3"/>,

        <xref ref="article4-p8"/>, and 
        <xref ref="article4-p9"/>.
    </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
  <p>
        Some of my key take-aways from the reading this
        week were that: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                not every <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m> is invertible
                (as I had falsely assumed earlier)
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                                <q>the empty set is not
        an object of this category</q>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                values which are <q>undefined</q> get sent to the
                <em>distiguished point</em> 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I think there's a close connection between this
        category <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m> as a form
        of <q>trinary logic</q>. In <xref ref="session21-p2"/>,
        I examined this idea with respect to the existence 
        of a <q>gender map</q>.  We can make a <q>binary</q>
        question into a <q>trinary</q> one by adding an option
        for <q>undefined</q>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm also wondering if this is connected to what 
        I was doing in <xref ref="session27-p15"/>. 
        We can interpret a pair of maps 
        <m>X \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow}}
          Y</m>
          as inducing an endomap <m>Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}</m>
          and it's inverse <m>\beta^{-1}</m>.  However,
         just because the endomap is invertable doesn't mean
         the original maps are. By
        adding in a <q>distinguished point</q>,
        I'm thinking that will introduce a way to 
        tell if <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are the same object
        or not, because it gives me a place to send 
        the point <m>y_9</m> in my example
        that did not come from any 
        <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x_i} X</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the diagrams from Exercise 20 are
        still relevant, but I want to have one more
        as a reference:

            I'm also thinking I'll need an updated 
            <q>universal sum</q> definition, so let's 
            attempt that also:

                    is an object <m>Q</m> together with
                    maps <m>C_i \xrightarrow{q_i} Q</m>
                    (one for each <m>i</m>) having the universal
                    property:
                </p>
            <p>
                Given any object <m>Y</m> and maps 
                <m>C_i \xrightarrow{g_i} Y</m>, there
                is exactly one map <m>Q \xrightarrow{g} Y</m>
                such that all triangles below commute, or 
                <m>g q_i = g_i</m> for all <m>i</m>.

    <p>
        Having collected some resources to start with,
        I think I can stop here and take a closer look
        at the first exercise next time.
