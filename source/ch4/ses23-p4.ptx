        Let's try to wrap up this session this week
        so I can keep moving forward.

            <p>
                I think I want to start here by organizing the
                information I have so far (or at least what I think
                I have).

            </tabular>
            <p>
                If I'm right about <m>\mathbb{N}^{()+1}</m> being the initial
                object in <m>\mathcal{S}^\circlearrowright</m>, maybe the initial
                object in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>
                will somehow pair each arrow with its opposite.  The authors have 
                previously discussed an object <m>\Omega</m> which acts like
                the inverse to <m>\mathbb{N}^{()+1}</m>.  This would take a 
                graph like <m>\boxed{\bullet \rightarrow \bullet \circlearrowleft}</m>
                and pair it with the graph <m>\boxed{\bullet \leftarrow \bullet \circlearrowleft}</m>.
                This second graph is important because while it can exist 
                in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>,
                it does not exist in <m>\mathcal{S}^\circlearrowright</m> because
                an endomap can't have two arrows originating at the same point.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the category <m>S</m> we already saw that our 
                definition of product means that  
                <m>\emptyset \rightarrow \emptyset+\mathbf{1}</m>
                and <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \emptyset+\mathbf{1}</m>
                are two uniquely defined maps.  If we think of the sum
                as <q>put together with no overlap and no interaction</q>,
                combining the empty set with anything doesn't change it giving
                us a unique map defined by 
                <m>\emptyset+\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>.
                Combining something with a new object necessarily
                would have to change the set, so we'd need to have
                <m>\mathbf{1} + \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{2}</m>. 
                This effectively establishes a bijection between
                <m>\mathbb{N}</m> and sets of the respective sizes:
                <m>\{\emptyset,\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2},...\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the category <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>
                our terminal objects aren't points but loops.  However,
                there should be an isomorphism between the set of
                <m>n</m> points and a cycle of that length.  
                If we think of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> as a <q>cycle of length 0</q>, 
                then <m>C_0 = \mathbb{N}</m> allows use to form an isomorphism
                <m>\mathbb{N} \leftrightarrows \{\emptyset,\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2},...\}
                    \leftrightarrows
                    \{\mathbb{N},C_1,C_2,...\}
                </m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While experimenting with Lean 4 the other week,
                I noticed that the category theory library contained
                separate definitions for <q>small</q> and <q>large</q>
                categories.  The documentation suggested that the difference 
                was that a <q>large category</q> could contain itself as 
                an object.  I'm starting to wonder if that property is 
                related to role of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> in this bijection 
                <m>\mathbb{N} 
                    \leftrightarrows
                    \{\mathbb{N},C_1,C_2,...\}
                </m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <m>\mathcal{S}^\circlearrowright</m>, we 
                observed that there were
                <m>n</m> possible structure preserving maps from
                <m>C_n \rightarrow C_n</m>. Maybe we can use the 
                notion of <q>initial object</q> to narrow that down
                to one.  Given any cycle <m>C_n</m>, we have a unique
                map <m>I \rightarrow C_n</m> that we could use 
                to identify which element is <q>point 0</q>.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the cycle of two.  There are precisely two
                <m>\mathcal{S}^\circlearrowright</m>-maps 
                <m>C_2 \rightarrow C_2</m>.  If we combine the
                cycle with the initial object, we get a unique
                map <m>I \rightarrow C_2+I</m> and through composition
                with the unique map <m>I \rightarrow C_2</m> can construct
                a unique map <m>C_2 \rightarrow C_2+I</m>. However,
                this operation <m>+I</m> can't preserve the 
                structure of <m>\mathbb{N}^{()+1}</m> because there is no
                map <m>C_2 \rightarrow C_3</m> in
                 <m>\mathcal{S}^\circlearrowright</m>.  It would follow
                that <em>any</em> composition 
                <m>\mathbb{N} \rightarrow I \rightarrow C_n</m> would have 
                to be unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an attempt to put this all together, I'm thinking that 
                an my objects in 
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>
                should have a general structure that looks like this:

                        \node (A0) at (0,3) {$\bullet$};
                        \node (A1) at (0,2) {$\bullet$};
                        \node (A2) at (0,1) {...};
                        \node (C0) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
                        \node (C1) at (1,-1) {$\bullet$};
                        \node (C2) at (0,-2) {...};
                        \node (C3) at (-1,-1) {$\bullet$};

                            (A0) edge (A1)
                            (A1) edge (A2)
                            (A2) edge (C0)

                            (C3) edge[bend left] (C0)

            <p>
                If the <q>cycle</q> has a length <m>n</m> and the tail
                has length <m>m</m> then there's precisely one map from
                tail of length <m>m+n</m> to this object.  This is consistent 
                with my earlier hypothesis that our initial object in 
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>
                is actually just <m>\mathbb{N}</m> itself.

        Having <q>tried</q> the exercise, I think it's about time
        to press on and hope the authors clarify things a bit more.
