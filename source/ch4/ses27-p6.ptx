        <statement>
            <p>
                If both <m>E, p</m> and <m>F, q</m> are equalizers...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The text has defined an <em>equalizer</em> of 
                two maps <m>f,g: X \rightarrow Y</m> as a map
                <m>E \xrightarrow{p} X</m> if <m>fp = gp</m>
                and for each <m>T \xrightarrow{x} X</m> for which
                <m>fx=gx</m>, there is exactly one <m>T \xrightarrow{e_E} E</m>
                for which <m>x = p e_E</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>F, q</m> is also an equalizer of the same pair
                <m>f,g</m>, then <m>F \xrightarrow{q} X</m> must
                satisfy <m>fq = gq</m> and for each <m>T \xrightarrow{x} X</m>
                for which <m>fx=gx</m>, there is exactly one <m>T \xrightarrow{e_F} F</m>
                for which <m>x = q e_F</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're asked to prove that there is a unique map <m>F \xrightarrow{e} E</m>
                for which <m>p e = q</m> is an isomorphism.  
            </p>
            <p>
                By the definition of <m>T</m> as a terminal object, 
                there is a unique 
                map <m>E \xrightarrow{\bar{e_E}} T</m> and a unique map 
                <m>F \xrightarrow{\bar{e_F}} T</m>. I claim that
                <m>e_E \circ \bar{e_F}</m> is actually the unique map 
                <m>F \xrightarrow{e} E</m> for which <m>p e = q</m> and 
                <m>e_F \circ \bar{e_E}</m> is its unique inverse
                <m>E \xrightarrow{e^{-1}} F</m>.
                To establish this, I need to show <m>pe=q</m>, <m>e^{-1} e = 1_F</m>,
                and <m>e e^{-1} = 1_E</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose <m>F \xrightarrow{pe} X \neq F \xrightarrow{q} X</m>.  There would need to exist some 
                some <m>T \xrightarrow{f'} F</m> such that 
                <m>p e f' \neq q f'</m>.  Expanding <m>e</m> with my above
                defintion gives us <m>p e_E \bar{e_F} f' \neq q f'</m>.
                Since <m>\bar{e_F} f'</m> is a map <m>T \rightarrow T</m>
                it could only be the unique map <m>1_T</m>. It follows that
                <m>p e_E \bar{e_F} f' = p e_E 1_T = p e_E \neq q f'</m>.
                Since <m>q f'</m> is a map <m>T \xrightarrow{x} X</m>,
                the definition of <m>E, p</m> as an equalizer says that for there
                is exactly one map <m>p e_E = x</m> for all <m>x</m> satisfying
                <m>fx = gx</m>, contradicting our
                assumption that <m>pe \neq q</m> and implying that in fact
                <m>pe = q</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expanding <m>e^{-1} e</m> using those definitions above
                gives us <m>(e_F \circ \bar{e_E}) \circ (e_E \circ \bar{e_F})</m>
                .  We can regroup these terms using the associative property 
                to get <m>e_F \circ (\bar{e_E} \circ e_E) \circ \bar{e_F}</m>.
                Since <m>(\bar{e_E} \circ e_E)</m> is a map <m>T \rightarrow T</m>,
                it could only be the unique map <m>1_T</m>. Our expression
                for <m>e^{-1} e</m> becomes <m>e_F \circ 1_T \circ \bar{e_F}</m>
                or simply <m>e_F \circ \bar{e_F}</m>.
        
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose <m>e_F \circ \bar{e_F} \neq 1_F</m>. 
                There would need to be 
                some <m>T \xrightarrow{f'} F</m> such that 
                <m>e_F \bar{e_F} f' \neq f'</m>.  However,
                <m>\bar{e_F} f': T \rightarrow T</m> could only possibly 
                be the map <m>1_T</m>.  It follows that <m>e_F \neq f'</m>,
                but this contradicts our definition of <m>e_F</m> as an
                equalizer if we post-compose by <m>q</m> to get
                <m>q e_F \neq q f'</m>.  The composition
                <m>q f'</m> is a map <m>T \rightarrow X</m>
                <m>q e_F = x</m> so any <m>q f' \neq q e_F</m>
                would contradict the definition of <m>e_F</m>
                as an equalizer.
            </p>
        
            <p>
               Likewise, expanding <m>e e^{-1}</m> gives us
               <m>(e_E \circ \bar{e_F}) \circ (e_F \circ \bar{e_E})</m>.
               Once again, the terms in the middle can be regrouped 
               to get <m>e_E \circ (\bar{e_F} \circ e_F) \circ \bar{e_E}</m>
               and we can use the fact that <m>\bar{e_F} \circ e_F = 1_T</m>
               to simplify down to <m>e_E \bar{e_E}</m>.  If <m>e_E \bar{e_E}</m>
               were anything other than <m>1_E</m>, it would contradict 
               our definition of <m>e_E</m> as an equalizer.
            </p>
        </solution>

        This is still a bit confusing, but hopefully the follow-up 
        exercises shed some more light on it.
