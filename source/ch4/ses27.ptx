        Let's jump right in!
    </p>
    <example>
        <title>Exercise 1:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Prove that if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are objects and 
                <m>A \times B = \mathbf{1}</m>, then
                <m>A = B = \mathbf{1}</m>...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                They asked me to <sq>translate</sq>, so that's what
                I'll try to do!
            </p>
            <p>
                With the statement <m>A \times B = \mathbf{1}</m>,
                we're assuming we have we have a pair of
                 projection maps 
                <m>A \xleftarrow{p_1} \mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{p_2} B</m>
                such that for <q>every</q> object <m>X</m> with maps 
                <m>A \xrightarrow{f_1} X \xleftarrow{f_2} B</m> there
                is exactly one map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} \mathbf{1}</m>
                with <m>f_1 = p_1 f</m> and <m>f_2 = p_2 f</m>.
                 Our category
                must allow compositions so we know we have some map
                <m>X \xrightarrow{f} \mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{f_1} A</m>
                 in <m>\mathcal{C}</m>.
            </p> <p>
                Suppose <m>g : X \rightarrow A</m> is a another map 
                in <m>\mathcal{C}</m> such that <m>g \neq p_1 f</m>.
            </p><p>
               For <m>g \neq p_1 f</m> to be true, 
               there where would need to exist some
                <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X</m> such that 
                <m>g x \neq p_1 f x</m>.  Or more explicitly:
                <me>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X \xrightarrow{g} A
                    \neq
                    \mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X \xrightarrow{f} \mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{p_1} A
                </me>
                However, the composition <m>f x</m> is a
                map <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>
                and there's only one such map: namely the identity
                 <m>1_\mathbf{1}</m>.
                The right side of this can be simplified using the associative 
                property <m>p_1 f x = p_1 1_\mathbf{1} = p_1</m>.
                This implies <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
                are the same map.
          
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, there is exactly one map <m>X \rightarrow A</m>
                and one map <m>X \rightarrow B</m>.  This implies
                <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <em>terminal objects</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that completes the proof.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    
    <p>
        This proof seems deceptively simple.  
        I feel like the rest of these exercises are going 
        to get deep, so I'm going to rest here for now.
