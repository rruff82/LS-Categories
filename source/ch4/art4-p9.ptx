        I think I was at least on the right track last week,
        so let's pick up work again on the distributive property.

          <p>
            I've been thinking about these product and sum families,
            and maybe the benefit of looking at indexed objects is that 
            it allows me to gradually extend these diagrams
            with the sums and products of objects.  Given that
            I already have <m>C_0 = A, C_1 = B, C_2 = C</m>,
            maybe I can let start adding combinations of these 
            objects under the product or sum as additional objects 
            in our category.  In particular, I'm curious about the
            objects <m>C_3 = B+C</m>, <m>C_4 = B \times C</m> 
            because that
            pair shows up in both sides of the distributive property.
            Let's try adding those to my diagram from last week. I'm
            going to colorize the graph such that my evalations from
            the left are in blue and right in red.

            Essentially, we've defined "triple map" 
            from <m>A \times B \times C</m> to 
            <m>A + B + C</m> that corresponds uniquely
            to our choice of <m>f</m>:
          </p>
          <me>X \rightarrow A \times B \times C 
            \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow  \\ \longrightarrow}}
            A+B+C \rightarrow Y</me>
          <p>Since every map in this category <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m> 
            is of the form <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow \mathbf{1}
            </m>, we can use this to define a isomorphism from
            <m>A+B+C \longrightarrow A \times B \times C</m>. 
            </p>
    
        <me>A+B+C \rightarrow Y \rightarrow \mathbf{1} \rightarrow X \rightarrow A \times B \times C 
             </me>
          <p>
            This, in turn, allows me to define some endomaps on the 
            spaces <m>A \times B \times C</m> and <m>A+B+C</m>
            by the following compositions:
          </p>
          <me>A \times B \times C 
            \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow  \\ \longrightarrow}}
            A+B+C \rightarrow Y \rightarrow \mathbf{1} \rightarrow X 
            \rightarrow 
             A \times B \times C 
          </me>
          <me>
            A+B+C \rightarrow Y \rightarrow \mathbf{1} \rightarrow X 
            \rightarrow 
            A \times B \times C
            \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow  \\ \longrightarrow}}
            A+B+C
          </me>
          <p>
            Let's name these <m>A \times B \times C \xrightarrow{e_P} 
              A \times B \times C</m> and 
              <m>A + B + C \xrightarrow{e_S} 
                A + B + C</m>.  I'm thinking that since we constructed 
                these by splitting an isomorphism between 
                <m>A + B + C</m> and <m>A \times B \times C</m>, 
                we know they at least satisfy the properties
                <m>e_P^2 = 1_{A \times B \times C}</m> and 
                <m>e_S^2 = 1_{A+B+C}</m>.
                Perhaps the question to be asking here is 
                whether or not <m>e_P,e_S</m> <em>are</em>
                the respective identity maps or are maps with
                no fixed point?  This allows us to define two
                unique maps to <m>\mathbf{2}</m> based on this 
                fixed point property. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Let's continue by adding these maps to our diagram,
              and complete it with the other possible sums and products
              needed for our distributive property:

          <p>
            Maybe I've haven't been paying enough attention 
            to the second condition: the fact that <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow A \times 
                \mathbf{0}</m> is an isomorphism.  
            Every <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m> admits an unique map
            <m>X \mathrel{\substack{\longrightarrow  \\ \longrightarrow}}X \times Y</m> 
            that pairs each <m>x_i</m> with the respective 
            <m>\langle x_i,y_i \rangle</m> pair.  We also
            saw in the last exercise that
            can define a map <m>X \times Y \rightarrow \mathbf{2}</m>
            based on whether <m>x_i = y_i</m> or <m>x_i \neq y_i</m>.
            We know we have a unique <q>antipodal map</q> 
            <m>\mathbf{2} \xrightarrow{\alpha} \mathbf{2}</m>
            such that <m>\alpha^2 = 1_\mathbf{2}</m>.  This 
            is important because we could use this map to swap
            the roles of our terminal and initial object.  
    
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm thinking that the existence of this map 
            <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow A \times \mathbf{0}</m>
            is important because it gives us our monoid 
            <m>\mathbb{N}</m> through composition with itself.
            This gives us an isomorphism between the following
            sequences of maps:
             <me>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow A \times \mathbf{0}
              \rightarrow A \times A \times \mathbf{0}
              \rightarrow A \times A \times A \times \mathbf{0}
              \rightarrow ...
             </me>
             <me>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}
              \rightarrow \mathbf{2}
              \rightarrow \mathbf{3}
              \rightarrow ...
             </me>
             It seems we should be able to assume an 
             isomorphism <m>A \leftrightarrow \mathbb{N}</m>
             here without loss of generality.
          </p>
          <p>
            If our distributive property is to hold for arbitrary 
            choices of <m>A,B,C</m>, what happens if we choose 
            <m>B = \mathbf{1}</m> and <m>C = X</m>?  Subsituting
            into our distributive property gives us
            <m>A \times \mathbf{1} + A \times X = A \times (X + \mathbf{1})</m>.
            Our result from 
            Exercise 9 says that any terminal object
            in <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m> is also initial,
            so <m>X + \mathbf{1} = X + \mathbf{0} = X</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I'm pretty lost again, but here's my hunch as to  
            whats happening.  Both the sum and product need to each have 
            a unique element that functions as the identity map. 
            This gives us unique map from <m>\mathbf{2} \rightarrow X
             \rightarrow \mathbf{2}</m> for 
             <m>\mathbf{2} = \{\mathbf{0},\mathbf{1}\}</m>.
            In the same way we saw a monoid arise from
            <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow A \times \mathbf{0}</m>,
            there should also be <em>dual</em> notion of the
            monoid based on <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow B+\mathbf{1}</m>,
            and some map which swaps the behavior of these two monoids. 
            The invertability of maps in <m>\mathbf{1}/\mathcal{S}</m> 
            conflicts with this because we know there can't exist
            a retraction for <m>\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>.

      <title>Exercise 21:</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A, D</m> denote the generic arrow and the naked dot...
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we're given that <m>A = \boxed{\bullet \rightarrow \bullet}</m>
          and <m>D = \boxed{\bullet}</m>, and in the category 
          <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>
          we know that all maps must satisfy <m>s' f_A = f_D s</m>
          and <m>t' f_A = f_D t</m> to preserve source and target.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start by creating a <q>section</q> on <m>X</m>
          that categorizes each element into a <q>dot</q> or
          <q>arrow</q>. Let's call this "binary" map 
          <m>X \xrightarrow{b} \{\text{dot},\text{arrow}\}</m>. 
           Since <m>X = X_A + X_D</m>,
           this gives us a unique pair of 
          injections <m>X_A \xrightarrow{j_1} X</m> and 
          <m>X_D \xrightarrow{j_2} X</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For any arrow in <m>X_A</m>, we have a unique 
          map <m>X_A \mathrel{\substack{s \\ \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\ t}}
          X_D \times X_D</m> that decomposes the arrow into 
          a pair of dots. I think the catch here is that this projection
          map <m>X_A \xrightarrow{p_A} A</m> needs to preserve structure
          when we compose it with the map <m>X_D \xrightarrow{p_D} D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's consider an arbitrary pair of arrows <m>a_1,a_2</m> 
          in <m>X</m>.  These arrows can share a source, share a target, 
          share neither, or they could share both.  Each pair of arrows
          corresponds with a minimum of one dot and a maximum of four.
          We should then be able to take a sum of those dots as per the 
          following diagram:

          Let's consider the relationship between the 
          dots and arrows of a finite digraph <m>X</m>.  
          If there are <m>|X_D| = n</m> dots in the diagram, 
          there are a maxiumum of <m>n^2</m> possible arrows 
          between those dots.  For each <m>x_a</m>
          in the set of arrows <m>X_A</m>, we can assign a unique
          index to that arrow that preserves the source and target.
          This gives us unique pair of maps 
          <m>X_D \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_n</m> and 
          <m>X_A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_n \times \mathbb{N}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{n^2}</m>.
          Furthermore, knowing these sets are disjoint should also give us an isomorphism
          <m>\mathbb{N}_{n}+\mathbb{N}_{n^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{n+n^2}
          </m> preserving the separation of dots and arrows.  Since we know <m>X_D+X_A = X</m>, it follows that
          we have a unique isomorphism <m>X \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{n+n^2}</m> as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's look at a pair of arrows 
          <m>\langle a_1,a_2 \rangle \in X_A \times X_A</m>.  
          If there are <m>|X_A| = m</m> arrows in the originial 
          diagram, then there are <m>m^2</m> possible pairs of
          arrows.  This gives us a map 
          <m>X_A \times X_A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{m^2}</m> that 
          indexes those arrows.  
          Given that we have at most as many arrows as are possible, 
          it follows that <m>m \leq n^2</m> we should have a unique
          map <m>\mathbb{N}_{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{n^2}</m>
          which links the index of an arrow in <m>X_A</m>
          with an indexed pair of points in <m>X_D</m>.  We can effectively
          use this to define a map <m>\mathbb{N}_{n^2} \rightarrow \mathbf{2}</m>
          by the property that returns <m>1</m> if there's an arrow 
          connecting the two dots or <m>0</m> if not.  
        </p>
        <p>
          So what happens when we try to inject our set of <em>dots</em>
          into the set of <em>arrows</em>?  Each dot <m>x_d \in X_D</m> 
          can be thought of as an arrow where the source and target are 
          both the same point.  This gives us a map from 
          <m>\mathbb{N}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{n^2}</m> that pairs 
          each point with the theoretical index of an arrow pointing 
          to itself.  We've got two cases, one where there already 
          exists a self-loop at that point and one where this
          arrow is a new object of its own.

          This is starting to become a lot of information,
          so let's see if we can organize my thoughts a bit better
          in a diagram:

          So where does that leave us?  I'm guessing that the
          structure preservation of maps in our category gives us
          that pair of maps from 
          <m>D \mathrel{\substack{s \\ \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\ t }} A</m>
          and we can use the sum in our category to find the 
          unique map for which all triangles below commute:

          Maybe the key to all is to section off the points in <m>X_D</m> that contain
          corresponding self loop in <m>X_A</m> from the dots which 
          loop, <m>D_L</m>, and dots which do
          not ,<m>D_N</m>.  This gives us <m>X_D = D_L + D_N</m>
          where each <m>D_L</m> is paired with an existing arrow in <m>X_A</m>.  
          If <m>|D_L|</m> represents how many points that applies to,
          then the remaining <m>|D_N|</m> end up creating new points.
          Each pair of arrows <m>A \times A</m> can be thought of as
          the sum of some arrows <m>A</m> where the source and target are different,
          with these objects <m>D_L, D_N</m> that section off the points and loops.  
          Could this give us the 
          <m>A \times A \rightarrow A + D_L + D_N</m> we're looking for?
  
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
      <p>
        I'm not exactly happy with these solutions,
        but at this point I think the best course of action
        is to move forward.  It sounds like some of my confusion
        will be addressed with the proof of the distributive property
        later in the text.
