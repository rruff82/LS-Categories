        <statement>
            <p>
                Continued from last week...
            </p>

            <p>
                So I think I made things unnecessarily difficult
                last time with how I chose to enumerate the 
                objects of the category.  I'm starting to think
                it would be simpler if I define <m>C_0 = S</m>
                and <m>C_1 = T</m>. If our category has a product,
                then there's a unique object <m>C_2 = S \times T</m>
                such that the diagram below would commute.

                        \node (X) at (0,0) {$S$};
                        \node (Y) at (1,1) {$T$};
                        \coordinate (HOFF) at (0.05,0);
        
                        \coordinate (VOFF) at (0,0.05);

                            ($(XtY.south)+(HOFF)$) edge ($(X.north)+(HOFF)$)
                            ($(X.north)-(HOFF)$) edge ($(XtY.south)-(HOFF)$)
                            (XtY) edge (Y)

            <p>
                Since <m>S</m> is initial there's a unique map
                <m>S \xrightarrow{p} S \times T</m>. That means
                the compositions with our projection maps
                would need to be the unique maps
                <m>p_1 p = S \rightarrow S</m>
                and 
                <m>p_2 p = S \rightarrow T</m>.  It seems to 
                follow that
                the product of an initial object with any object
                would also need to be initial itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's allow <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m> to
                be an arbitrary map in the category. If 
                we define <m>\Gamma = X \xrightarrow{\langle ?,f \rangle} X \times Y</m>
                to map each <m>1 \xrightarrow{x_i} X</m> in 
                <m>X</m> to the respective pair 
                <m>\langle x_i, f x_i \rangle</m>, then clearly
                this definition implies both
                both 
                <m>p_X \Gamma = 1_X</m> and <m>p_Y \Gamma = f</m>.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>p_X \Gamma = 1_X</m>, that means <m>\Gamma</m>
                is a section for <m>p_X</m>.  Maybe we just need to 
                prove its unique?
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose some other map <m>X \xrightarrow{g} X \times Y</m>
                satisfied <m>p_X g = 1_X</m> and <m>p_Y g = f</m>.  The condition
                that <m>\Gamma \neq g</m> implies the existence of 
                a point <m>T \xrightarrow{x} X</m> such that
                <m>\Gamma x \neq g x</m>.  Maybe we can try precomposing 
                by <m>S \rightarrow T</m>?  That would give us two 
                separate maps <m>S \rightarrow Y</m> which is supposed to be 
                uniquely defined.  This contradiction means our assumption is 
                false and <m>\Gamma</m> is unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm wondering if the main idea here 
                is that even if <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m>
                is not invertible, the map defined here as 
                <m>X \xrightarrow{\Gamma} X \times Y
                </m> <em>must be</em>.
                For <m>f^{-1}</m> to not exist, there must be some
                <m>T \xrightarrow{y} Y</m> with two different maps
                <m>T \xrightarrow{x_1} X</m> and <m>T \xrightarrow{x_2} X</m>
                satisfying <m>y = f x_1 = f x_2</m>. Even
                if <m>f</m> isn't one-to-one, we come up with
                a map that is by treating the points
                <m>\langle x_1, y \rangle</m> and 
                <m>\langle x_2, y \rangle</m> as two distinct values. 
            </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
        I'm not sure if I'm leaving this off in any better state
        than it was last week, but I'm also not sure if it's worth
        spending any more time on.  In my defense, it's been a 
        <em>difficult</em> week.
