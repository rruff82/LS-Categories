    <title>Session 24: Uniqueness of products and definition of sum</title>
    <p>
        I feel kind of relieved by this chapter.  Some 
        of the things I've been conjecturing have been
        make more explicit. There are still some loose
        ends for me to tie up, but I feel like I've gotten
        some confirmation that I'm on the right track.

                are both sums of <m>B_1,B_2</m> in 
                a given category.

                The definition of <m>S</m> as a sum says that
                for any two maps <m>B_1 \xrightarrow{f_1} X</m>
                and <m>B_2 \xrightarrow{f_2} X</m>, there is 
                exactly one map <m>S \xrightarrow{f} X</m> 
                such that <m>f_1 = f j_1</m> and <m>f_2 = f j_2</m>.

                We'd like to demonstrate that this map is an isomorphism,
                so we need to to find an inverse to it.  Since <m>\bar{S}</m>
                is also a product in the category, this defines a unique
                map <m>\bar{S} \xrightarrow{k} S</m> for which 
                <m>j_1 = k \bar{j_1}</m> and <m>j_2 = k \bar{j_2}</m>.

                Let's make the claim that <m>h,k</m> are inverses.
                Namely, that <m>k h = 1_S</m> and <m>h k = 1_\bar{S}</m>.
                Consider the following compositions:
            </p>
            <me>(k h) j_1 = k (h j_1) = k \bar{j_1} = j_1</me>
            <me>(k h) j_2 = k (h j_2) = k \bar{j_2} = j_2</me>
            <p>
                The map <m>k h</m> composed with <m>j_1</m> gives
                <m>j_1</m> and composed with <m>j_2</m> gives 
                <m>j_2</m>.  By choosing <m>f_1 = j_1</m>
                and <m>f_2 = j_2</m>, the definition of sum says that
                there's a unique map satisfying <m>f j_1 = j_1</m>
                and <m>f j_2 = j_2</m>.  Since this is uniquely
                satisfied by <m>f = 1_S</m>, we've can conclude
                that <m>k h = 1_S</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, we can reverse the roles of <m>S,\bar{S}</m>
                and examine the following compositions:
            </p>
            <me>(h k) \bar{j_1} = h (k \bar{j_1}) = h j_1 = \bar{j_1}</me>
            <me>(h k) \bar{j_2} = h (k \bar{j_2}) = h j_1 = \bar{j_2}</me>
            <p>
                By the same reasoning, the unique map <m>g</m> for which 
                all <m>g \bar{j_1} = \bar{j_1}</m> and 
                <m>g \bar{j_2} = \bar{j_2}</m> could only be the 
                unique identity map <m>g = 1_\bar{S}</m>.  It follows 
                that <m>h k = 1_\bar{S}</m> and completes the proof
                that <m>S</m> is isomorphic to <m>\bar{S}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having proved the result, I still feel like 
                there's a weak spot in my understanding of that last 
                step.  I'm thinking it has to do with the properties 
                of <q>epimorphisms</q> and <q>monomorphisms</q> in 
                relation to the identity map.  In the proof for the 
                product, we rely on the fact that pre-composing by <m>hk</m>
                didn't change anything while in the proof for
                sum we rely on the fact that post-composing by
                <m>k h</m> didn't change anything. 
                My hunch is that this is related to the connection between
                the section, retraction, and inverse.  If an inverse map
                exists, then the section and retraction are both equal to it.

            Having these two diagrams, how do I then compare them
            for equality?  I think the idea is to show they can be
            factored through the terminal object.  In particular,
            the maps from arrows to the terminal object form a
            bijection between the arrows in the sum and product.

        <p>
            The important characteristic I notice in this diagram
            is that that while we have 2 maps <m>A \rightarrow T</m>
            on each side, we have 4 maps <m>D \rightarrow T</m>
            and on the left and 5 maps <m>D \rightarrow T</m> on the 
            right.  This makes me wonder if two of the dots in 
            the product need to collapse down to a single dot somehow.
            I'm wondering if I can resolve this difference 
            by treating the terminal object as one of the elements
            in <m>2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also not yet accounting for the <q>self-loops</q>
            either. I'm thinking the way to resolve this is to
            treat the self-loops in the products as the
            identity maps on <m>B_1,B_2</m>.  I can 
            group the two sets <m>B_1,B_2</m> on the left
            into a the sum <m>B_1+B_2</m> and form a bijection
            with my product <m>2 \times D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting both of these changes together gives us 
            the following diagram:

            Now every <q>dot</q> maps to a <q>self-loop</q>.
            Since there's exactly one map
            <m>\boxed{\bullet} \rightarrow \boxed{\bullet \circlearrowleft}</m>
            our isomorphism above must be the <q>only</q>
            one. I say <q>only</q> in quotes, because the
            chose of assigning <m>p_1,p_2</m> to <m>j_1,j_2</m>
            is arbitrarily chosen but <em>any</em> choice 
            is isomporphic to the other.  There's a unique map
            <m>\alpha</m> such that 
            <m>\alpha \langle p_1, p_2 \rangle = \langle p_2, p_1 \rangle</m>
            and this map would have corresponding <m>\beta</m>
            such that <m>\beta \langle j_1, j_2 \rangle = \langle j_2, j_1 \rangle</m>.

            Now let's look at Part (b), which says 
            <m>D \times D = D</m>.  It seems like
            it should be obvious from the diagram of 
            the graph product:

            I think in this case we establish the bijection 
            between <m>j_1,j_2</m> and the inherent 
            source and target maps of the arrow <m>s,t</m>.
            However, it's not exactly clear to me how
            quite yet so lets try to factor through <m>\mathbf{1}</m>
            again.

            Like before, maybe the key here is 
            to group the terminal object and 
            dot together as a single object.
            This would give us the following
            isomorphism:

            And that complete our proof!  Or at least,
            I think it does...

        This seems like a good place to stop for the

        again it's going to get complicated.
