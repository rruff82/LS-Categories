    <title>Session 25: Labelings and products of graphs, Part 2</title>

    <p>
        As I continued to read further, I realized my solution
        to last week's Exercise is probably not correct.  I'm
        also beginning to think that I need to finish my solution
        to certain outstanding problems (i.e. Session 15) before I can proceed
        any further.  It's possible I might be stuck here a while...
    </p>

        <title>Exercise 1: (Part 2/?)</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Proofreading last week's work...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
Immediately after this Exercise, the author's define a graph
<m>A_2</m> with the exact graph I thought was going to be
<m>2_A</m>.  It seems incredibly unlikely that <m>A_2 = 2_A</m>
would be the same graph, so my answer is almost certainly 
wrong. I decided to take a closer look at the examples leading
up to his.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been starting to form a tighter connection
                between the graphs and the adjacency matrices.
                The object <m>D</m> defined as the 
                <q>naked dot</q> is essentially a 
                <m>1\times1</m> matrix given by
                <m>\begin{bmatrix}
                    0
                    \end{bmatrix}</m>.  Likewise,
                the <q>naked arrow</q> <m>A</m> can be
                thought of a <m>2\times2</m> matrix
                given by <m>\begin{bmatrix}
                    0 &amp; 1 \\
                    0 &amp; 0 
                    \end{bmatrix}</m>.
                By concatenating matrices along the 
                diagonal and filling in zeroes, we
                can produce a graph sum such that
                <m>D+D = \begin{bmatrix}
                    0 &amp; 0 \\
                    0 &amp; 0 
                    \end{bmatrix}</m> and 
                    <m>A+A = 
                        \begin{bmatrix}
                        0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
                        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0                        
                        \end{bmatrix}</m>.
                        I also get a nice representation
                        of the <q>naked loop</q> as the 
                        matrix <m> 
                        \begin{bmatrix} 1                    
                        \end{bmatrix}</m>.
                    </p>
            <p>
                However,
                it's important to note that this method 
                of a graph sum doesn't commute. The matrix
                <m>D+A = \begin{bmatrix}
                    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
                    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
                    \end{bmatrix}</m> is distinct from
                <m>A+D = \begin{bmatrix}
                        0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
                        \end{bmatrix}</m>   
                if we're using an element-wise comparison.
                Even though they're not the same, they're 
                <q>isomorphic</q> in that they both have 
                exactly 3 dots and one arrow connecting
                two of them so every thing has a pair.
             </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of pairs, I think that's why our
                maps to <m>C_2</m> are important.  Using
                the matrix notation, <m>C_2</m> can be thought 
                of as <m>\alpha = \begin{bmatrix}
                    0 &amp; 1\\
                    1 &amp; 0
                    \end{bmatrix}</m> which happens to be the
                    unique antipodal matrix satisfying 
                    <m>\alpha^2 = I_{D+D}</m>. Multiplying 
                    this matrix with the arrow matrix gives 
                    me the sum of a naked dot and a loop,
                    as represented by the matrix form
                    <m> 
                        \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1                    
                        \end{bmatrix}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                What strikes me as interesting about this
                matrix representation is the way the graph
                decribed in the text as <m>2_D</m> corresponds
                with the matrix <m> 
                    \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1                    
                    \end{bmatrix}</m>. 
                This is the unique matrix that takes every
                element in the matrix of <m>D+D</m> and 
                swaps zeroes to ones.  It got me wondering what
                would happen if I applied the same operation
                to <m>A+A</m>.  This matrix, given by <m>
                    \begin{bmatrix} 
                    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 
                    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
                    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
                                      
                    \end{bmatrix}    
                </m>, produces the following graph:

                I'm starting to think that 
                this might be the graph <m>2_A</m>
                that I was looking for.  The reason
                I'm so convinced of this is the way om
                which it resembles a particular shape 
                on the cover of the book:

            <p>
                Using the notation I have been, this graph
                corresponds with the matrix given by <m> 
                    \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 2                    
                    \end{bmatrix}</m> (with the 2 repesenting
                     my second self-loop).  This seems relevant
                    because taking these
                    elements modulo 2 and multiplying by my antipodal matrix
                    gives me back the original arrow
                    <m> 
                        \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1

            </p>
            <p>
                I think I want to spend a little more time
                playing with this.  I think this notion of a
                <q>graph negation</q> operation could have some 
                useful properties with respect to my sum and product.
