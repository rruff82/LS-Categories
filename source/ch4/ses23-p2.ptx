            <p>
                The goal here is use these objects <m>B_1</m> and
                <m>B_2</m> in <m>\mathcal{C}</m> as the 
                basis for constructing a new category 
                <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We define an <em>object</em> in <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>
                as an object of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> equiped with a pair 
                of maps to <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We define a <em>map</em> in <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>
                as a map in <m>\mathcal{C}</m> which preserves the
                structure of the commutative diagram above.  
                Specifically, any map <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y</m>
                in <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m> must satisfy the relations
                <m>\psi_1 f = \phi_1</m> and <m>\psi_2 f = \phi_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since every <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>-map comes from a 
                map <m>\mathcal{C}</m>, it must have a defined domain 
                and codomain. Likewise, since the objects in 
                <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m> come from objects in
                <m>\mathcal{C}</m> they must each have an identity
                map.  For any object <m>X</m> in 
                <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>,
                a simple substitution <m>\phi_1 1_X = \phi_1</m> and
                 <m>\phi_2 1_X = \phi_2</m> 
                shows the identity maps from <m>\mathcal{C}</m>
                preserve structure.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a second to verify
                that <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m> is closed under composition.
                Consider two maps <m>X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xrightarrow{g} Z</m>.

                We can assume the following relations from 
                the definition of <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>-map: 
                <me>\psi_1 f = \phi_1</me>
                <me>\psi_2 f = \phi_2</me>
                <me>\chi_1 g = \psi_1</me>
                <me>\chi_2 g = \psi_2</me>
                In order for <m>g \circ f</m> to be a valid
                <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>-map, we need to 
                establish both <m>\chi_1 (g \circ f) = \phi_1</m>
                and <m>\chi_1 (g \circ f) = \phi_1</m>.  This follows
                easily from the associative property in <m>\mathcal{C}</m>
                and substitution with the relations above:
                <me>\chi_1 (g \circ f) = (\chi_1 \circ g) \circ f = \psi_1 \circ f = \phi_1</me>
                <me>\chi_2 (g \circ f) = (\chi_2 \circ g) \circ f = \psi_2 \circ f = \phi_2</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing left to prove is the associative law.
                Let's consider a set of 
                three <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>-maps 
                <m>A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \xrightarrow{h} D</m>.
                Each of these maps needs to correspond with a pair 
                of maps to <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>, as per 
                the following diagram:

            <p>
                By our definition of composition above, 
                we know we have 
                <m>g \circ f</m> satisfying 
                <m>\chi_1 (g \circ f) = \phi_1</m>
                and <m>\chi_2 (g \circ f) = \phi_2</m>.
                Postcompose with <m>h</m> to get 
                <m>h \circ (g \circ f)</m> with 
                <m>\omega_1 (h \circ (g \circ f)) = \chi_1 (g \circ f) = \phi_1</m>
                and 
                <m>\omega_1 (h \circ (g \circ f)) = \chi_1 (g \circ f) = \phi_1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, we must have <m>h \circ g</m>
                satisfying <m>\omega_1 (h \circ g) = \psi_1</m> 
                and  <m>\omega_2 (h \circ g) = \psi_2</m>.
                Precompose with <m>f</m> to get 
                <m>(h \circ g) \circ f</m> with 
                <m>\omega_1 ((h \circ g) \circ f) = (\omega_1 (h \circ g)) \circ f
                   = \psi_1 f = \phi_1</m>
                and 
                <m>\omega_2 ((h \circ g) \circ f) = (\omega_2 (h \circ g)) \circ f
                    = \psi_2 f = \phi_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we know that the associative property holds in
                <m>\mathcal{C}</m> and have shown that it satisfies
                the structure preservation of <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>,
                that should complete the proof that <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>
                is a valid category.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m> is a category,
                what should the terminal object look like?
                Per definition, a terminal object <m>T</m> should have 
                the property that for every object <m>X</m> in 
                <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>, there is exactly 
                one map <m>X \xrightarrow{\tau} T</m>.  As an 
                object in <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>, the terminal
                object <m>T</m> must be accompanied by a 
                pair of maps <m>T \xrightarrow{\tau_1} B_1</m> 
                and <m>T \xrightarrow{\tau_2} B_1</m> such that 
                <m>\tau_1 \tau = \phi_1</m> and <m>\tau_2 \tau = \phi_2</m>
                where <m>\phi_1,\phi_2</m> are the respective pair of maps
                associated with <m>X</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since every object has an identity map, this rule must 
                also apply to <m>T</m>. Since any <m>X \rightarrow T</m>
                is unique, then the uniqueness of <m>T \rightarrow T</m>
                implies it could only be the map <m>1_T</m>. Clearly
                <m>1_T</m> satisfies <m>\tau_1 1_T = \tau_1</m> and 
                <m>\tau_2 1_T = \tau_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now suppose we have a <m>\mathcal{C}</m>-map 
                <m>B_1 \xrightarrow{\beta} T</m>, which we should
                by the definition of terminal object. In order for this map
                to be a map in <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>,
                we'd need a pair of maps <m>B_1 \xrightarrow{\beta_1} B_1</m> 
                and <m>B_2 \xrightarrow{\beta_2} B_2</m> 
                which preserve the structure of the following

                These maps need to preserve the structure of

                and <m>\tau_2 \beta = \beta_2</m>. Since

                If we take <m>\tau_2 = \beta_2 \tau_1</m> and precompose with 
                <m>\beta</m> again, we get
                <m>\tau_2 \beta = \beta_2 \tau_1 \beta</m> which simplifies to
                <m>\beta_2 = \beta_2 \beta_1</m> whichs implies that 
                <m>\beta_1 = 1_{B_1} = \tau_1 \circ \beta</m>.  It would 
                also follow that <m>\beta_2</m> is uniquely determined 
                by the sequence of maps <m>B_1 \xrightarrow{\beta} T \xrightarrow{\tau_2} B_2</m>.
                Essentially, since the objects <m>T,B_1,B_2</m> are all 
                isomorphic to each other in <m>\mathcal{C}</m> we can 
                use the uniqueness of the maps there to guarantee the
                uniqueness of our maps in <m>\mathcal{C}_{B_1 B_2}</m>.

                I'm thinking that the idea here is that there is not 
                just a bijection between the objects <m>X</m> and <m>T</m>, 
                but one between the pairs of maps 
                <m>\langle \phi_1, \phi_2 \rangle</m> and 
                <m>\langle \tau_1, \tau_2 \rangle</m> themselves.  
                Consequently, any bijection between 
                <m>\boxed{P,\pi_1,\pi_2} \leftrightarrows \boxed{T,\tau_1,\tau_2}</m>
                automatically defines an unique bijection 
                <m>\boxed{X,\phi_1,\phi_2} \leftrightarrows \boxed{P,\pi_1,\pi_2}</m>
                through composition.

                I attempted something similar to this back in Article 4
                Exercise 19. We let <m>I</m> be a <q>possibly empty</q> set
                of indices and let <m>C_i</m> be a <q>possibly duplicated</q>
                object in the category.  This gave us the following 
                definition of <q>sum family</q>: 
                <xref ref="def-art4-ex18-sum-family"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sure if I need all that for this exercise though.
                I think I might get away with using only the definitions of 
                initial object, terminal object, and sum.  I'm going 
                to mirror the wording of product from Session 21.

                I think we'll also need the following uniqueness theorem,
                which we proved in Article 4 Exercise 7:

            <theorem xml:id="thm-session23-initial-object-uniqueness">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        If <m>S,I</m> are both initial in <m>\mathcal{C}</m>
                        then the unique map <m>S \rightarrow I</m> is an 
                        isomorphism.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </theorem>
            <p>
                In the category <m>\mathcal{S}</m>, we can think of 
                our initial object <m>I</m> as the empty set <m>\emptyset</m>.
                There is a unique map from <m>\emptyset</m> to any other 
                object in <m>\mathcal{S}</m> because there's no elements 
                for any arrows to originate at.  Likewise, we can 
                think of the terminal object in <m>\mathcal{S}</m>
                as the singleton <m>\mathbf{1}</m> since there's only one
                object for the arrows to point to.
            </p>
            <p>
                By substituting <m>A = \emptyset</m> and <m>B = \mathbf{1}</m>, we can 
                form the following diagram:

                Since <m>i_1</m> is a unique map, it follows 
                that <m>i_1 = i_2 \circ i_0</m>.  Likewise,
                we must also have <m>j_1 = j \circ i_1</m> and 
                <m>j_2 = j \circ i_2</m>.  We can subsitute our 
                expressions to get 
                <me>j_1 = j \circ (i_2 \circ i_0) = (j \circ i_2) \circ i_0</me>
                <me>\implies j_1 = j_2 i_0</me>
                There is no map from
                <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \emptyset</m> in <m>\mathcal{S}</m>,  
                so the only possible choice of <m>I</m> for the diagram above 
                is the sum <m>\emptyset+\mathbf{1}</m> with 
                <m>j = 1_{\emptyset+\mathbf{1}}</m> respectively.

                There's a lot to unpack here but I'm wondering if the importance is that
                looping the sequence <m>S \rightarrow I \rightarrow S \rightarrow I</m>
                provides a way to construct the monoid <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.
                Given a map <m>\mathbb{N} \rightarrow I</m>,
                the compositions 
                <m>\mathbb{N} \rightarrow I \rightarrow C_i</m>
                would give us all the information we need about
                the structure of <m>X</m>.
