        I think I want to try something a little different with this 
        next exercise and write out the proofs for sum and product 
        side by side.

                    If such an inverse exists it must necessarily be unique,
                    so the <q>at most one map</q> property follows from this uniqueness.

                    Effectively, if we have a epimorphism 
                    <m>s: \mathbf{0} \rightarrow C</m> we can construct 
                    the unique map <m>C \xrightarrow{g} X</m> relative to 
                    <m>s^{-1}: C \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m> by way of the composition
                    <m>C \xrightarrow{s^{-1}} \mathbf{0} \rightarrow X</m>.
        
                    If such an inverse exists it must necessarily be unique,
                    so the <q>at most one map</q> property follows from this uniqueness.

        I think that was good practice.  The two proofs are basically the 
        same but mirrored.  It still seems weird how we used points 
        to test for equality when there's no points in <m>\mathbf{0}</m> 
        for the category of sets, but hopefully the next exercise will help
        with that.
