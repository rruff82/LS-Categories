    <title>Session 25: Labelings and products of graphs, Part 5</title>

    <p>
         I was going to try to make it through this Session and
         move on, but our air conditionor had other plans for me.
         It's
         really hard to focus on math when it's oppressively 
         hot like this.  Still, I'm trying to make a little 
         progress each week so I'd like to at least attempt
         one exercise.

    </p>

    <example>
        <title>Exercise 4: (Part 2/2?)</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Sequence of graphs...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Let's start with (a), because I think the idea here
                is that <m>X \longrightarrow \mathbf{0}</m> effectively
                represents <em>my old model of a map</em>.  I've been
                struggling with the concept of map <m>P \xrightarrow{g} G</m> from person to gender ,
                has been so troublesome because I allowed <m>g p</m> to 
                be <q>undefined</q>.  It's not that my old method is
                necessarily wrong, it's just that not allowing this 
                situation will be necessary to accurately count the maps
                we want to find.
           </p>
           <p>
                This question implies that we're working in the 
                category of graphs 
                <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>,
                so thus maps <m>X \xrightarrow{f} \mathbf{0}</m>
                 must preserve source and target maps.

           <p>
                That is to say, for every map 
                <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x}</m>
                we have both <m>f_D s_X x = s_\mathbf{0} f_A x</m>
                and <m>f_D t_X x = t_\mathbf{0} f_A x</m>.
                Since every map in <m>\mathcal{S}^{\downarrow_\bullet^\bullet \downarrow}</m>
                comes from a map in <m>\mathcal{S}</m>,
                and there's exactly one map <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m>,
                we must have <m>s_\mathbf{0} = t_\mathbf{0} = 1_\mathbf{0}</m>.
                It follows that for every <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X</m>,
                we have <m>f_D s_X x = f_A x</m> and 
                <m>f_D t_X x = f_A x</m> which implies that 
                <m>f_D s_X = f_D t_X = f_A</m>.
           </p>
           <p>
                Next, let's consider the map <m>D \xrightarrow{g} X</m>.
                It too must preserve structure of source and targets:

                For any <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{d} D</m>, we must

                <m>g_D t_D d = t_X g_A d</m>.  However,
                there are no arrows in <m>D_A</m>!  It follows 
                that <m>s_D, t_D</m> are both the unique map 
                <m>\mathbf{0} \longrightarrow D</m> from 
                the empty set to the single dot in <m>D</m>.  Since
                <m>s_D = t_D</m>, it follows from the structure
                preservation property that <m>s_X g_A = t_X g_A = g_D</m>.

           <p>
             Since there are no arrows in <m>D</m>, <m>D_A = \mathbf{0}_A</m>
             as sets and therefore <m>f_A \circ g_A</m> 
             could only be the unique identity map on
             <m>\mathbf{0}_A</m>.  It also follows that 
             <m>s_D</m> and <m>t_D</m> would both need to be
             the unique
             map <m>\mathbf{0} \longrightarrow D</m>.  However,
             the composition <m>f_D \circ g_D</m> defines a map
             <m>D \longrightarrow \mathbf{0}</m> which does not 
             exist as a map in <m>\mathcal{S}</m>.  Having 
             both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> together implies a 
             contradiction. 
           </p>
           <p>
             Finally, let's consider the case where neither
             <m>f</m> nor <m>g</m> are maps.  If there is no
             map <m>X \longrightarrow \mathbf{0}</m>, then there's
             at least one point <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X</m>
             with no place to send it to. By the definition of 
             <m>\mathbf{1}</m>, there's a unique map 
             <m>X \xrightarrow{\bar{x}} \mathbf{1}</m> such that
             <m>\bar{x} x = 1_\mathbf{1}</m>.  Likewise,
             any <m>\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{d} D</m> must also
             have a corresponding <m>D \xrightarrow{\bar{d}} \mathbf{1}</m>
             such that <m>\bar{d} d = 1_\mathbf{1}</m>.  It follows 
             that the composition <m>x \bar{d}</m> is a map
             <m>D \xrightarrow{\bar{d}} \mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} X</m>
             which contradicts our assumption that no such map
             exists.
           </p>
           <p>
             I think the idea here is if we can look at 
             the objects of <m>X</m> by looking at compositions
             of the form <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow X \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>.
             But before we do that we need to some way of telling if 
             <m>X \neq \mathbf{0}</m> or <m>X \neq \mathbf{1}</m>. 
             Having a map <m>X \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m>
             means that <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow X \rightarrow \mathbf{0} = 1_\mathbf{0}</m>
             and <m>X \rightarrow \mathbf{0} \rightarrow X = 1_X</m>,
             constituting an isomorphsims between <m>X</m> and the 
             initial object.  Since having a category with sums and 
             products guarantees
             a map <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>, the 
             non-existence of a map <m>X \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m>
             implies the existance of unique composition
              <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow X \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>.
              The existance of a dot <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow D</m>
              therefore gives us our map <m>X \rightarrow D</m> through
              composition.

             Let's move on and consider the case in part (b).  </p>

            Suppose we have a map <m>X \xrightarrow{f'} D</m>.

             map <m>\mathbf{0} \rightarrow D</m>. That means that
             in order to preserve structure, we'd need to have

           <p>
                After putting this all together, here are some
                of my observations.   
           </p>
           <p>
                First, both of these maps can't exist together
                because <m>f_A \circ g_A</m> is not a valid map.
                There is exactly one arrow in <m>A_A</m> and 
                zero arrows in <m>D_A</m>, and there is no map
                in <m>\mathcal{S}</m> from the singleton to the 
                empty set.
           </p>
           <p>
                I think the reason we need at least one of them
                to exist is related to the fact that we have 
                two unique maps <m>A \rightarrow D</m> named <m>s,t</m>.
                I've indicated these by the purple.  If we
                have a map <m>X_A \rightarrow D_A</m>, then that 
                essentially gives us a map <m>X_A \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m>
                that means <m>X</m> is isomorphic to the initial object.
                This retraction can't exist if <m>A \rightarrow X</m> 
                is a map because there's no retraction for the unique
                map <m>\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>.
           </p>
           <p>
                I'm thinking the idea between parts (c) and (d) is that 
                I'm being set-up with a successor function 
                for an inductive argument, so I'm going to
                try to summarize my progress so far.
           </p>
            <p> 
                The idea behind (a) was that 
                having a map <m>X \rightarrow \mathbf{0}</m>
                effectively means
                <m>X = \mathbf{0}</m> by <q>graph isomorphism</q>.  If our
                graph is not empty, then there must be at least one point 
                which is defined by a map <m>\mathbf{1} \rightarrow X</m>. 
                By the definition of <q>terminal object</q>, there's a unique
                map <m>D \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m> that we could precompose
                our point by to get a map <m>D \rightarrow X</m>.
           </p>
           <p>
                The idea behind (b) was that a similar line 
                of reasoning applies to our arrows.  The naked
                arrow has two dots and the naked dot has one.
                Since the map <m>\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>
                is non-invertable, having both of these maps 
                gives rise to a contradiction.
           </p>
           <p>
                For part (c), I'm thinking of this in terms of 
                object counts.  There's 2 dots and 1 arrow in <m>A</m>. 
                There's 3 dots and 2 arrows in <m>A_2</m>.  We've got 
                no retraction for <m>\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}</m>
                nor <m>\mathbf{3} \rightarrow \mathbf{2}</m>, so any
                map <m>A_2 \rightarrow A</m> must be non-invertable.
                Let's see what the external diagram looks like
                if we attempt to compose <m>A_2 \rightarrow X</m> 
                with <m>X \rightarrow A</m>.

           <p>
                Having both of these maps together is problematic
                because the only map <m>T \rightarrow T</m> is necessarily 
                the unique identity map.  Both of these maps can't exist
                simultaneously because they're not invertable.
        
           </p>
           <p>
                The logical answer for part (d) would seem to be
                <m>C = A_3</m>, or the following graph:
                <me>\boxed{\bullet \longrightarrow \bullet \longrightarrow \bullet \longrightarrow \bullet}</me>
                It also seems like defining <m>A_0 = D</m> would make an
                obvious choice.  We could then start to formulate our 
                induction hypothesis: <m>\forall n \in \mathbb{N}
                </m> exactly one of <m>A_{n+1} \rightarrow X, X \rightarrow A_n</m>
                is a map.   There's also likely a
                parallel statement for the dots under the convention that 
                <m>D_n = A_{n-1}</m>.
           </p>         
        </solution>
    </example>
   
   <p>
        I'm still a little fuzzy on all this, but at least 
        this gives me something to refer back to later
        when I'm better able to focus.
