    <title>Session 27: Examples of universal constructions, Part 14</title>


    <example>
        <title>Exercise 11:</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Say that <m>Y \xrightarrow{h} Z</m> is <em>cosolution</em>...
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We're defining a <em>cosolution</em> <m>Y \xrightarrow{h} Z</m> 
                such that <m>h f = h g</m>
                for a pair of parallel maps 
                <m>X \mathrel{\substack{f \\ \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\ g}} Y</m>.
                We want to show that if this cosolution is <q>universal</q>,
                any other cosolution <m>Y \xrightarrow{h'} Z'</m>
                can be uniquely expressed as <m>h' = q h</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I think the first step would be figuring out what
                this <m>q</m> is. Based on the equation <m>h' = q h</m>,
                we can infer that the domain and codomain are 
                <m>Z \xrightarrow{q} Z'</m>.  </p>
                <p>The choice of <m>q</m> also 
                seems like a successor reference to the <m>p</m> in the
                definition of equalizer.  
                My intuition suggests that the <q>universality</q>
                of our cosolution implies that the map <m>q</m> is 
                the unique <em>isomorphism</em> such that <m>q^{-1} q = 1_Z</m>
                and <m>q q^{-1} = 1_{Z'}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to show that <m>h</m> is an <q>epimorphism</q>.
                This was defined back in Article II as a map <m>Y \xrightarrow{h} Z</m>
                such that for any
                object <m>T</m> and pair of maps <m>Z \mathrel{\substack{t_1 \\ \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\ t_2}} T</m>,
                if <m>t_1 h = t_2 h</m> then <m>t_1 = t_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having laid out that information, what if we assume 
                <m>h</m> is not an <q>epimorphism</q>?
                The statement <m>t_1 h = t_2 h \implies t_1 = t_2</m>
                is only false
                when we have two maps <m>Z \mathrel{\substack{t_1 \\ \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\ t_2}} T</m>
                satisfying <m>t_1 h = t_2 h</m> but with <m>t_1 \neq t_2</m>. 
                However, if <m>T</m> is a terminal object then there's precisely
                one map <m>Z \rightarrow T</m> so no such <m>t_1, t_2</m> can 
                exist.   It follows that our assumption was false
                and <m>h</m> is an epimorphism. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That seems so simple I'm not even sure if I trust it.
                I feel like I need to more explicitly connect the 
                map <m>Z \xrightarrow{q} Z'</m> to this somehow.
                It seems completely reasonable that if <m>Z</m> and 
                <m>Z'</m> are both terminal objects they'd have to 
                be isomorphic, but I'm not really sure I've established
                either of them in such a way.  Nor did I reference the original
                maps <m>f,g</m>.  I was also expecting a need 
                to invoke the sum <m>X+Y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I wrap up this exercise, let's also try to
                address the parenthetical. I think it would be good
                to attempt a formal definition of co-equalizer by 
                swapping domain and codomains around in the definition
                of equalizer:
            </p>
            <definition xml:id="def-coequalizer-ses27-ex11">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        <m>Y \xrightarrow{q} E</m> is a
                         <term>co-equalizer</term> of 
                         <m>X \mathrel{\substack{f \\ \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \\ g}} Y</m>
                        if <m>q f = q g</m> and for each
                        <m>Y \xrightarrow{\bar{y}} T</m> for which
                        <m>\bar{y} f = \bar{y} g</m>, there is
                        exactly
                        one <m>E \xrightarrow{\bar{h}} T</m>
                        for which <m>\bar{y} = \bar{h} q</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
            <p>
                I'm not really sure if that's correct.  In naively 
                swapping all the arrows like I did, I ended up naming
                maps <m>\bar{h},\bar{y}</m> that are uniquely defined 
                by domain and codomain.  The idea of using a <q>for each</q>
                statement over such uniquely defined maps seems like 
                a contradiction in terms.  Maybe I need to turn my equation
                around and express it in terms of a unique
                <m>T \xrightarrow{h} E</m> satisfying <m>q y = h</m> 
                for all <m>T \xrightarrow{y} Y</m>?
            </p>
        </solution>

    </example>
    
    <p>
       I know there's only one exercise left in the session,
       but it looks like it has a lot of parts to it.  Hopefully
       my answer here is <q>close enough</q> to give me something
       to work with moving forward.
