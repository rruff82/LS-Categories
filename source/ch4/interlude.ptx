    <title>Interlude: <q>Paws</q> for Reflection</title>
    <p>
        I never really stated this goal publicly, but back
        when I started Category Theory Caturday in April 
        2023 I also made the decision to begin watching 
        <q>One Piece</q> on Netflix.  
    </p>
    <p>
        For those unfamiliar with the anime, <q>One Piece</q>
        has been an ongoing series for over twenty years now.
        Unlike other anime series where I typically binge 
        watch them over a few weeks, this was a series where
        I knew that would never be healthy option.  Instead,
        I made a commitment to watch <q>one episode per day
        on average</q>.  With Netflix listing over a 
        thousand episodes and counting, I expected catching
        up to take at least 3 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        On January 1st of 2025, my plans were smashed.  
        Apparently there's a gap in Netflix's licensing 
        arrangement and the series skips from episode 628
        to 1089.  My longstanding morning routine of 
        watching cartoon pirates while I drink my coffee 
        came to sudden and abrupt end. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I bring all this up now because after 90 weeks of 
        posting math and cat pics, my streak of making 
        weekly progress has been broken.  For the first 
        time since I started this endeavor, I simply could 
        not make sufficient space for myself to devote the
        kind of attention to this work that it duly
        requires.  
    </p>
    <p>
        While I'm a bit sad that it came to this, the 
        reality of my current situation means that Cat 
        Theory Caturday may need to be put on <em>paws</em>
        for a bit. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This story is far from over.  Even once I make it 
        through L&amp;S, there's still Lurie waiting on my 
        bookself.  That's enough math for years to come, 
        and my old-man baby cats are still as adorable as
        ever.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there's something I've learned from all this, 
        it's that having a steady routine for learning is 
        so incredibly important.  A while back I blogged 
        about the 
        <url href="https://suburbanlion.com/blog/2024/03/11/performance-assessments-and-mathematical-thinking/" >
        importance of mathematical-thinking skills </url>
        but what I see now is that those skills alone are not 
        sufficient.  It's the product of those skills with 
        <em>TIME</em> to exercise them that make learning 
        possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <q>Cat Theory Caturday</q> will return once I can settle 
        in with a new routine that gives these exercises
        the amount of time they require.  Until then, 
        keep calm and mooch for snacks my friends!
