By using a bit of water in a clear container, you could convievably build a rudamentary level by comparing the slant of the water against a marked line.  The only tricky part is designing it so you could align it with the points you want to compare, but the basic idea is that if the points are level then the water wouldn’t tilt. The authors’ use of the word "level" in the prompt makes me think they were heavily leading the reader towards something like this.  A level makes it easy to hang pictures expressly because it removes the need to measure up from the floor.</div></div></details></div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="session1.html#example-2">in-context</a></span>
