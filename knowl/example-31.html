<div class="para">As I was proof reading, I noticed an error in Exercise 3 Part (e).  It was a simple case of me not reading the question as precisely as needed. I think I was so excited to show (d) was an isomorphism that I didn’t give (e) the amount of skepticism it deserved.  I mistakely read the domain as <span class="process-math">\((\mathbb{R},+)\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\((\mathbb{R},\times)\)</span> which made finding a counter-example trivial relative to the actual problem.</div> <div class="para">As I was looking over my solution to fix this, I noticed something else kind of odd. My solution began with "Let’s go one at a time" but I had addressed some of the problems in pairs.  There’s something that felt natural about approaching them this way, but it also seemed kind of ironic that I had failed to produce a isomorphism between my problems and solutions in a section that was all about matching things up.</div> <div class="para">All of this started to get my thinking about the solutions to these problems as a map <span class="process-math">\(\set{a,b,c,d,e,f} \overset{s}{\longrightarrow} \set{isomorphism,non-isomorphism}\text{.}\)</span> Obviously this map is not invertable, but it made me wonder if the "Hints" to this section provided sufficient information about the functions to identify each one.  Is there some set of descriptions that would establish a one-to-one relationship with these problems?</div>

<div class="para">The first hint tells us that only one of these maps is a "genuine isomorphism", which I concluded was (d). The last hint says that one is "not even a map", which I concluded is (f). The hint that "[s]ome... dont respect the combining rules" explains why I rejected (a) and (e).  It also seems natural to ask "does it have a section?" and "does it have a retraction?".</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.4.10<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Table of selected map properties for Exercise 3</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">These four questions are <em class="emphasis">almost</em> enough to identify every problem except for distinguishing between (a) and (e).  The best description of the difference is that (a) fails to preserve the combining-rules <em class="emphasis">in every case</em> while (e) might pass or fail the combining-rules depending on its input.  This is a very subtle difference that I probably would have overlooked had I not made the mistake that I did.</div>
