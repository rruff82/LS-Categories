<div class="para">Assuming we started with some positive integer and applied <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to it, it would be in the table above and this map <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will return the number we started with.  Thus we have a well defined retraction becaues <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f = 1_{\mathbb{Z}^+}\text{.}\)</span>  However, Cantor's diagonal argument suggest that there still exists at least one real number in the interval (0,1) for which there is no inverse.  Consider the real number constructed by taking a single "bit" from each line of the table following the diagonal and flipping it while adding trailing zeroes to the right as needed:</div>
