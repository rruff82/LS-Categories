<div class="para">There is however, one map that might have the property <span class="process-math">\(m x = y x \forall t \in I_t\text{.}\)</span>  Imagine my "evil twin".  This twin starts in the opposite city and takes the opposite that I do along the way. If <span class="process-math">\(any\)</span> map is going to avoid coming into contact with me at every step in my journey, it would have to be him.  He takes every step I do, but in the opposite direction!  This is the composition of my map with the "antipodal map" on <span class="process-math">\(I_t\)</span>â€” it takes every moment in my journey in reverse. If my map is continuous, so is my evil twin.  If there's a sequence of arrows, we can reverse them.</div>
