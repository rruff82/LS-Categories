<div class="para">As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats "playing with toys".  Given that they are cats, I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result.  However, I also restrict their environment so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey.  What we percieve as "playing" is really a proxy for murderous insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.</div>
