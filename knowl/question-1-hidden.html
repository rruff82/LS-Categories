<body class="ignore-math"><article class="question example-like"> <div class="para">The part of Galileo's work which we discussed is really concerned with only a small portion of space, say the immediate neighborhood of the tower of Pisa.  Since the ground might be uneven, what could be meant by saying that the two points are at the same level?  Try to describe an experiment for deciding whether two nearby points are at the same level, without using 'height' (distance from an imaginary plane of reference).  Try to use the moset elementary tools possible.</div></article></body>
