<div class="para">This is where I started to notice some problems with my previous reasoning. In order for me to talk about the properties of <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f\text{,}\)</span> it didn’t make sense for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to be "undefined" for an element in my domain.  If I didn’t get something "out", I wouldn’t be able to feed it back in.  So instead of considering all <span class="process-math">\(4^3=64\)</span> possible "love triangles" I identified earlier, I could narrow my search down to a more limited set of <span class="process-math">\(3^3=27\)</span> maps by excluding the "psychopaths" from my romance movies because they make it impossible to produce a sequel (more on that idea later).</div> <div class="para">This narrowed my search, but 27 is still too many for me too sort out by hand so I started looking for ways to break it down further. I knew I could satisfy the <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f = f\)</span> constraint with the identity map because clearly <span class="process-math">\(1_A \circ 1_A = 1_A\text{.}\)</span>  I also know I could satisfy <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f = f\)</span> with a "constant function" such as the following:</div> <div class="para">Furthermore, there would need to be a total of 3 such "constant functions" because you’d need one for each of the 3 possible destinations.  At that point it seemed clear I was still missing some. If I could construct a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with 1 arrow to each point and also a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with 3 arrows to a single point, it seemed reasonable to assume there’d be a class of maps with 2 arrows leading to a single point.</div> <div class="para">Let’s consider the case where that point with two arrows leading in to be "John".  One of the arrows leading to John has to be from himself for <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f (J) = f(J)\)</span> to be true, but the other arrow could originate at either Mary or Sam.  Given these two possible maps exist for each person, we’d have <span class="process-math">\(3 \cdot 2 = 6\)</span> maps of this type.</div> <div class="para">Putting everything together, some patterns seem to emerge when I listed these out in a table using binomials.</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.1.10<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">
