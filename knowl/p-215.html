<div class="para">I think the point that the authors were trying to communicate was that our choice of units and magnitude for "time" are very specific to our origin on planet Earth.  If weâ€™re talking about units of "years" as being "one orbit around the Sun" and the origin as a socially defined "common era", then an alien race from another plant would likely have totally different system of dating then us.  However, most SI units are based on physical properties of our universe. Even if this species chose a different set of base units than us, we could match up measurements of certain elements to develop an <em class="emphasis">isomorphism</em> between our two systems.</div>
