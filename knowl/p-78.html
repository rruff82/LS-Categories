<div class="para">If teaching has taught me anything, it’s that people sometimes have very different ideas about what is meant by seemingly simple phrases like "the opposite of two".  It’s often too easy to fall into a trap in assuming that since I’m thinking of two as a position on the number line and the opposite of that is defined relative to the origin, but "negative two" is really only one possible answer.  If the question "what’s the oppositve of two?" had beem asked in the kitchen instead of a math class, there’s a case to be made that "one half" is actually the more appropriate response. The opposite of doubling a recipe is halving one.  There might even be situations where it may be helpful to think of "opposite" as both the reciprocal and negation, as you would with slopes of perpendicular lines.</div>
