Thus, <span class="process-math">\(X^{\circlearrowright \alpha}\)</span> has been labeled using it’s presentation already with the generators given as <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c,d\}\text{.}\)</span> Our presention includes following 4 relations:</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \alpha^5 a = \alpha^2 a\)</span></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \alpha^2 a = \alpha b\)</span></div></li>

<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \alpha^2 d = d\)</span></div></li>
</ol> <div class="para">We’re looking for maps <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> for which these generators from <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> get assigned to points in <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\((f \circ \alpha)(x) = (\beta \circ f)(x)\)</span> for every <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\text{.}\)</span>   For now, we’re not sure what assignments will make that happen so we’ll just call these mystery points <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = \bar{a}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(b) = \bar{b}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(c) = \bar{c}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(d) = \bar{d}\text{.}\)</span>  Since we established that <span class="process-math">\(f \alpha^n = \beta^n f\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\text{,}\)</span> we can match each of our relations on <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> with a corresponding relation on <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{:}\)</span>
</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \beta^5 \bar{a} = \beta^2 \bar{a}\)</span></div></li>

<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta \bar{c}\)</span></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \beta^2 \bar{d} = \bar{d}\)</span></div></li>
</ol> <div class="para">Beginning with the generator <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a}\text{,}\)</span> we’re going to look for a list potential points in <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> that satisfy our first relation: <span class="process-math">\(\beta^5 \bar{a} = \beta^2 \bar{a}\text{.}\)</span> The textbook helps us out by pointing out that <span class="process-math">\(w,x,y,z\)</span> meet this condition but <span class="process-math">\(l,m,p,q,r,s,t,u,v\)</span> do not. Thus, we can make four possible assignments for <span class="process-math">\(a\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{a} \rightarrow x, 
\bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{a} \rightarrow z\}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If we assign <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} \rightarrow w\text{,}\)</span> we can apply the operator <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> until we form a loop.  If we do so, we find that <span class="process-math">\(\beta \bar{a} = \beta w = x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta x = y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta y = w\text{.}\)</span> Our second relation implies that <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta \bar{b}\text{,}\)</span> but we already know <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = y\)</span> so that means that whatever we choose for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\)</span> must satisfy <span class="process-math">\(\beta \bar{b} = y\text{.}\)</span>  In the diagram, the only arrows leading into point <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are the arrows originating at <span class="process-math">\(x, z\text{.}\)</span>   Thus our only valid assignments for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\text{,}\)</span> given <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} \rightarrow w\text{,}\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b} \rightarrow x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b} \rightarrow z\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Given these two choices of <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\text{,}\)</span> we can start to narrow down our choices of <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\)</span> as well.  If we assume that <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = w = \beta \bar{c}\)</span> implies that <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\)</span> must have an arrow leading to point <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Presicely one point has that property, namely <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Our final relation specifies that <span class="process-math">\(m&gt;\beta^2 \bar{d} = \bar{d}\text{,}\)</span> and there’s only one 2-cycle in <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> that could satisfy this. This means that <span class="process-math">\(\bar{d}\)</span> needs to be either <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span>  Having exhausted all possibilities for maps such that <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} \rightarrow w\text{,}\)</span> we’re currently sitting on a list of 4 maps: <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow x, 
\bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow z, 
\bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow x, 
\bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow w, \bar{b} \rightarrow z, 
\bar{c} \rightarrow y, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]\text{,}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Moving on, our next possible assignment is <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} \rightarrow x\text{.}\)</span> Iterating from there gives us the following: <span class="process-math">\(\beta \bar{a} = \beta x = y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta y = w\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta w = x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">As before, our second relation limits our choice of <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\text{.}\)</span> Knowing <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = w = \beta \bar{b}\)</span> tell us that there must be an arrow from <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> and the only arrow with a target of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is the one originating at point <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} = w \implies \bar{b} = y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Testing our third relation places limits on <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = x = \beta \bar{c}\text{,}\)</span> the needs to be an arrow from point <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and this is uniquely satisfied by point <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Our choices for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{d}\)</span> are still independent of our choices for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c}\text{,}\)</span> specifically <span class="process-math">\(\bar{d} = \{l,m\}\text{.}\)</span> This gives us two new maps, <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow x, \bar{b} \rightarrow y, 
\bar{c} \rightarrow w, \bar{d} \rightarrow l]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow x, \bar{b} \rightarrow y, 
\bar{c} \rightarrow w, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]\text{,}\)</span> bringing our running total of maps to 6.</div> <div class="para">Our third option for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  If we assign <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} \rightarrow y\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(\beta \bar{a} = \beta y = w\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta w = x\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta x = y\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = x = \beta \bar{b}\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\)</span> must be <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> because there’s only one arrow leading into <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  With our third relation telling us <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = y = \beta \bar{c}\text{,}\)</span> that tells us that our choice of <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\)</span> must have an arrow leading to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  Two such points satisfy this, namely <span class="process-math">\(x,z\text{.}\)</span> For each of those choices of <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\text{,}\)</span> there are still two independent choices for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{d}\text{.}\)</span> This gives us a total of 4 maps with <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a} \rightarrow y\)</span> bringing our running total to 10.  Specifically,  our new maps are <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow y, \bar{b} \rightarrow w,

\bar{c} \rightarrow x, \bar{d} \rightarrow m]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Our final choice for <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span>  Going through our algorithm again, we start be iterating to get <span class="process-math">\(\beta \bar{a} = \beta z = y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = \beta y = w\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = \beta w = x\text{.}\)</span>  Our <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b}\)</span> must satisfy <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2 \bar{a} = w = \beta \bar{b}\text{,}\)</span> so the only choice is <span class="process-math">\(\bar{b} \rightarrow y\text{.}\)</span> Our <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c}\)</span> must satisfy <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3 \bar{a} = x = \beta \bar{c}\text{,}\)</span> so the only choice is <span class="process-math">\(\bar{c} \rightarrow w\text{.}\)</span>  Once again, our choice of <span class="process-math">\(\bar{d}\)</span> is still independent with two options of <span class="process-math">\(m,l\text{.}\)</span> These two maps, <span class="process-math">\([\bar{a} \rightarrow z, \bar{b} \rightarrow y,
