<div class="para">Okay, yeah, that’s partly because I’m lazy, but I think it’s also a good metaphor for what I learned about this week.  Writing these posts is a multi-stage process that resembles a sequence of map compositions.  I read (at least some of) the section, work out the exercises, then come back and revise.  What you see at the end is the composition, but not necessarily each step along the way. At the same time, some qualities of the end product itself may restrict the process leading to it but others leave flexibility.</div>
