<div class="para">Let's go one at a time, begining with (a): <span class="process-math">\((\mathbb{R},+) \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} (\mathbb{R},+)\)</span> given by <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = x + 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">While it seems like "subtract one" would be a reasonable inverse, this is not an isomorphism because it fails to respect the  combining-rule <span class="process-math">\(p(a+b)=p(a)+p(b)\text{.}\)</span>  Consider the case where <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 2\text{.}\)</span> We have <span class="process-math">\(p(a)=2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p(b)=3\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(p(a)+p(b)=5\text{.}\)</span>  However, this is not the same as <span class="process-math">\(p(a+b)\text{,}\)</span> which evaluates to <span class="process-math">\(p(1+2) = p(3) = 4\)</span> instead.</div> <div class="para">The map in (b) and the map in (c) are both closely related because they share a common definition of <span class="process-math">\(sq(x) = x^2\text{,}\)</span> but the domain and codomain.  Again there's an obvious inverse function of "square root", but the domains and codomains are what concern me.  Notable about (b) is that it fails to map "onto" the entire codomain, because the <span class="process-math">\(sq\)</span> map never produces any negative numbers as an output.  The map in (c) resolves this by limiting the codomain to non-negative values, but it still fails to "one-to-one" because both 1 and -1 produce an output of 1.</div> <div class="para">The map in (d) and (e) likewise have similar definitions.  The map defined by the given expression <span class="process-math">\(m x = -x\)</span> acts as its own inverse: <span class="process-math">\((m \circ m) (x) = m(m(x)) = m(-x) = -(-x) = x\text{.}\)</span>  Where (d) and (e) differ is in the "combining-rule".  If we have <span class="process-math">\(\set{a,b} \in \mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> then a little algebra can show that <span class="process-math">\(m(a+b) = -(a+b) = (-a)+(-b) = m(a)+m(b)\text{.}\)</span>  This means that both the indentity rules and the combining rule are satisfied for (d), making it the only genuine isomorphism in the list. The map in (e) fails to uphold the combining rule for <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 2\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(m(a+b) = -(1+2) = -3\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(m(a) \times m(b) = -1 \times -2 = 2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Finally we have the map (f), which isn't even a map with the specified domain and codomain because the cube of a negative number is still negative.  Had the map been defined with the correct codomain, <span class="process-math">\((\mathbb{R},\times) \overset{c}{\longrightarrow} (\mathbb{R},\times)\text{,}\)</span> then we'd potentially be able to define an inverse map by using the "cube root" function.</div>
