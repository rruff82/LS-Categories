<div class="para">In much the same way as the authors describe science as maps being used to understand reality, the education system uses assessments to understand what's going on inside a student's head.  Since we can't observe someone's state of mind, we alter their environment stimuli and see how they respond.  This presents problems when we're using map composition to turn one of many complex mental models down to a multiple choice question for the exam.  As long as a student could distinguish between "sort" and "partition" by the end of this unit, we don't really care how it impacted their broader understanding of world around them.</div>
