<div class="para">I'm not really sure what the question is, so I'm assuming this is a "prove it" problem.  I think this is essentially the approach I tried to take with Brouwer's theorems lasts.</div> <div class="para">If we define as set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> being "even" iff there is an involution with no fixed points.  This is like the "antipodal map" I explored earlier that pairs up each point in a space with it's "opposite".  When we're working with an antipodal map on the interval, we either we have a point in the middle that maps to itself or we "jump" over it.  The fixed point property becomes a proxy for whether or not the map is continuous because we forced the interval to be "odd". The only problem with using this idea here is that the interval had a natural order to it while the set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> may not, so our involution isn't necessarily unique.</div> <div class="para">Maybe it might help to think of taking a map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> applying and taking an "image" of it for every <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} A \xrightarrow{f} \text{Image}_f(A)\text{.}\)</span> Either we find some point <span class="process-math">\(f x = x\)</span> or we don't, but we can use this to classify each point as "fixed" or "not".  Essentially this process defines map <span class="process-math">\(g: A \longrightarrow\{0,1\}\)</span> that returns <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> if a point is fixed by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> if it doesn't.  However, since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is known to be an involution with <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f = 1_A\)</span> then there needs to be at least as many points in <span class="process-math">\(\text{Image}_f(A)\)</span> as there are in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> which ensures that <span class="process-math">\(\text{Image}_f(A) = A\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Framing the problem like this allows us to ask if there exists a section of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> which permits a retraction on <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span>  More specifically, we're looking for a map <span class="process-math">\(s: \{0,1\} \longrightarrow A\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(g \circ s = 1_{\{0,1\}}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f = 1_A\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\forall x \in A: g x = 1 \text{,}\)</span> and consequently <span class="process-math">\(s(0)\)</span> would be undefined.  If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has no fixed points then <span class="process-math">\(\forall x \in A: g x = 0\text{,}\)</span> and consequently <span class="process-math">\(s(1)\)</span> would be undefined.  In order for this map <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> to exist, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must have at least one fixed point and one non-fixed point.  That is, for some <span class="process-math">\(s(1) = x \in A\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(f x = x \)</span> and some <span class="process-math">\(s(0) = y \in A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f y \neq y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(g x = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g y = 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The problem with this is that such a map can't exist without <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> having at least three points: <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f y\text{.}\)</span>  It's impossible for a composition of the any form <span class="process-math">\(\{x,y,fy\} \longrightarrow \{0,1\} \longrightarrow \{x,y,fy\}\)</span> to ever produce an identity map. If a retraction for <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> existed it would need to be the same as the section, so clearly the fixed point property on <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> means that no map is a retraction from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I feel like I'm starting to talk in circles now, so I'll just add that I think there's some parallels to be made with the "split idempotent" exercise from Session 9.</div> <div class="para">If all points in <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are fixed, that implies a splitting of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\text{.}\)</span> If no points in <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are fixed, that also implies a splitting of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has both fixed and non-fixed points, that implies a splitting of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span>  Since there is no isomorphism between <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{,}\)</span> we use the result of Session 9 Exercise 3 to infer that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can't be split by both of them simultaneously.  If our <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has both fixed and non-fixed points, the set of fixed points would preserve an isomorphism with <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> â€” meaning that the point fixed by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> would necessarily be unique. Likewise, each non-fixed point <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> needs to exists as part of a pair with some <span class="process-math">\(f y\)</span> to preserve the isomorphism between <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{y,fy\}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I'm not sure if I'm using this concept of "splitting <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>" correctly here, but it seems like it might be a reasonable analogy of "division by two" for generic maps.</div>
