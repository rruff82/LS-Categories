<div class="para">What strikes me as special about our bipointed object here is that it provides a one-to-one correspondence between "dots" and "arrows". We know we can’t have a retraction from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> because there’s no retraction from a 2-point space to a 1-point space, but we can start building a common section. Let’s call this map <span class="process-math">\(i:S \longrightarrow \mathbf{1}\)</span> and define it such that <span class="process-math">\(i d_1 = i d_2 = d_0\text{.}\)</span>  The existence of this common section establishes that we have a <em class="emphasis">reflexive graph</em>. In Exercise 16, we proved that in a reflexive graph <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> is both determined by <span class="process-math">\(f_A\)</span> and implies that there’s an arrow forming a "self-loop" at each point.</div>
