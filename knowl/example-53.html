We can define a map <span class="process-math">\(r: D \longrightarrow C\)</span> that follows this arrow until it reaches the boundary point on the circle like so:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session10-ex1-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

If we could prove <span class="process-math">\(r \circ j = 1_C\text{,}\)</span> we’d have a contradiction and be done, but it’s not clear that’s the case quite yet. I think the key to this lies in the fact that <span class="process-math">\(g \circ j = j\text{.}\)</span>  In the text, they proved the special case where <span class="process-math">\(g = 1_D\text{.}\)</span>  This is a slightly more relaxation condition to show that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> doesn’t need to be the identity everywhere — it just needs to be the identity on the edge of the disk where it meets the circle.</div> <div class="para">I’m thinking of like taking a sample <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> from the embedding of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> rather than from <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> at large.  The text used the notation <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{b} C\)</span> to show this operation. Once we’ve chosen that <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> we can apply the map <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> to aquire our point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> on the edge of the disk.</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(C \subset D\text{,}\)</span> the rule that <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \neq g(x)\)</span> still applies, but if we force <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> to be the "head" of the arrow then we’ll have an arrow whose "head" lies on the boundary, which also happens to be the same point we originated from.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session10-ex1-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

This means that our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(\forall x \in D: f(x) \neq g(x)\)</span> is false, which is logically equivalent to the assertion that <span class="process-math">\(\exists x \in D: f(x) = g(x)\text{.}\)</span>  QED.</div> <div class="para">I must admint, this all feels a little "hand wavy" still.  I’m not really sure how much of Euclidean geometry I’m projecting onto the situation.  I think this is also a good spot to point out the "antipodal" map that we’d get by swapping the head and tail of our arrow between <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{:}\)</span>

The one situation where we’d have an endomap on the circle with no fixed points is the one that maps each point to the one opposite it, but this needs a fixed point for us to reflect over.  I think this is going to be important later.</div>
