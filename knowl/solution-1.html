<div class="para">Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps <span class="process-math">\(BEHAVIOR=NATURE \times NURTURE\)</span> might satisfy the pattern here.  The way my cats seem to behave is based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the "maps".</div> <div class="para">The diagrams in session 1 had the following structure:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 20%; margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session1-cd.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.2.2<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A typical diagram of the examples considered in L&amp;S "Session 1"</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">It didn’t really make sense to me to think of "behavior" as A in this diagram and nature/nuture as B/C because I could think of many situations where a single behavior might make sense in different environments. It seems more natural to think of behavior as function of environment rather than the environment as a function of the behavior. I feel like the qualities I identified might more accurately be arranged like so:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 20%; margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session1-alt.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.2.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Alternate explanation structure of behavior (A), nature (B), and nurture (C)</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">I think some of this unease comes from the complexity associated with behavior.  I think on some level I’m confusing a "behavioral genotype" with a "behavioral phenotype".  Being a cat creates a behavior profile of the actions they might engage in, but the environment selects for which actions are allowed to manifest.</div> <div class="para">Let’s define <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as "the set of animals".  We can consider "instincts" as a map <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> that maps each animal to its "natural behavior profile" in set B.  We can also consider "selection" as a map <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> that maps each animal to an "environmental reward profile" in set C.  Under these definitions, it seems reasonable to think of the composite map <span class="process-math">\(\phi \circ \theta\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(\theta \circ \phi\)</span>) producing an "observed behavior profile" in set D.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 20%; margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session1-full.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.2.4<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Full diagram of behavior expression as maps.</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">As an example of these maps in action, consider the case of my cats "playing with toys".  Given that they are cats, I know that they have certain hunting related instincts as a result.  However, I also restrict their environment so that they have stuffed toys instead of live prey.  What we percieve as "playing" is really a proxy for murderous insticts with no where else to go created by the combination of their instincts and the environment.</div> <div class="para">I think I can see how this additional structure helped to clarify what had started as an vague idea.  It makes a lot more sense to think of mapping from a specific cat to a behavior profile, than trying to map from a cat’s behavior profile to a specific environment.</div>
