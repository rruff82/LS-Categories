<div class="para">Since the following section is entitled "How to solve the quiz problems", I’m interpreting that as a sign that answering these problems publicly like this is acceptable use.  My time as a teacher has taught me that the primary distinction betweeen formatitve and summative assessments lies in how you use them, and this quiz seems to be treated like the former.  The goal is to provide students with a self-check on important concepts before the first "test".</div>
