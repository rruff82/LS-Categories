<div class="para">This is where I started to notice some problems with my previous reasoning. In order for me to talk about the properties of <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f\text{,}\)</span> it didn't make sense for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to be "undefined" for an element in my domain.  If I didn't get something "out", I wouldn't be able to feed it back in.  So instead of considering all <span class="process-math">\(4^3=64\)</span> possible "love triangles" I identified earlier, I could narrow my search down to a more limited set of <span class="process-math">\(3^3=27\)</span> maps by excluding the "psychopaths" from my romance movies because they make it impossible to produce a sequel (more on that idea later).</div>
