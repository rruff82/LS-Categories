<div class="para">I finally learned what a monoid is!  I feel like a whole new collection of math memes just opened up for me. As an added bonus, there were no exercises this week!  Rather than coming up with something of my own to do, I’m planning to use this opportunity to just reflect on the definitions for a week.  There seemed to be some close parallels betweeen this session and Peano’s axioms, but I think I’m just going to wait to see how the authors decide to develop things further.</div>
