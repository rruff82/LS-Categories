<div class="para">There’s a lot to unpack here.  Let’s start with the "bipointed object" in a category <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\text{:}\)</span>
</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex30-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.5.2<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Definition of bipointed object.</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Our goal is to demonstrate that "the graph of ’<span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> fields’ on <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is actually a <em class="emphasis">reflexive</em> graph".  Before I get there, I think I want to try to break down the "tempature field" situation to get my bearings.</div> <div class="para">My conventual notion of a "tempature field" would be like a map <span class="process-math">\(f: S \longrightarrow T\)</span> from some 3D-space such as <span class="process-math">\(S = \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> describing the position to a 1D-line such as <span class="process-math">\(T = \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> describing the temperature at each point in Kelvins.  Or at least that’s the basic idea that I’m trying to generalize. Maybe my space is the 2D image of a camera and my temperature line is an interval of temperatures it can detect.</div> <div class="para">I think this notion of a "heat map" produced by a digital camera is my best lead to go on.  Years of programming have taught me to think of this as "an array of bytes".  My input space is confined by the height and width of my image and my output space is limited by the precision of the image.  Let’s consider a <em class="emphasis">super</em> simple camera that only samples a 4x4 region and has only a 4 temperature resolution.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex30-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.5.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Trivial thermal camera as map <span class="process-math">\(f: \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_4 \)</span></figcaption></figure> <div class="para">The key feature that strikes me about this image is that despite this map being non-invertable we still must have a 1-1 correspondance between points in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> with the "arrows" of the map.  If we were able to "step out" of the map and look at it from a higher dimensional space we could think about the map as a collection of points <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> with 3 component properties defined by some maps <span class="process-math">\(s_x, s_y, t\)</span> which describe the position <span class="process-math">\(s_x,s_y\)</span> and temperature <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">It’s incredible unlikely that our temperature <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> alone is going to have an inverse map because neighboring points are likely to have similar temperatures.  However, if we have two objects <span class="process-math">\(x_1,x_2 \in X\)</span> which match for the whole map-triple <span class="process-math">\((s_x,x_y,t)\)</span> — such that <span class="process-math">\(s_x x_1 = s_x x_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s_y x_1 = s_y x_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t x_1 = t x_2\)</span> — that would necessarily imply that they’re the same object <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = x_2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">By looking at my "camera" in the higher dimensional space <span class="process-math">\(S \times T\)</span> I can think of it as an "endomap".  There’s only one detail which needs to be worked out, and that’s the fact that my original map had 16 arrows to go with each of the <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4 = 16\)</span> "dots", we’ve now added in the 4 additional dots from our temperature space <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>  For us to have a well-defined endmap, these dots would need to have arrows also. It seems natural that I’d want these new arrows to "loop".</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 85%; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex30-3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

The fact that any <span class="process-math">\(f: X \longrightarrow Y\)</span> must preserve source and target for our bipointed object can be expressed as the equations <span class="process-math">\(s_Y \circ f = f \circ s_X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t_Y \circ f = f \circ t_X\)</span> as per the the following commutative diagram.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex30-4.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.5.5<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Commutative diagram of source and target preservation</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Our "bipointed object" contains 3 arrows, which I’ll call <span class="process-math">\(a_0,a_1,a_2\text{,}\)</span> and 3 dots, which I’ll call <span class="process-math">\(d_0,d_1,d_2\text{.}\)</span> Let’s further specify that sources of our arrows are given by <span class="process-math">\(s a_0 = s a_1 = d_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s a_2 = d_1\text{,}\)</span> while the destinations are <span class="process-math">\(t a_0 = d_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t a_1 = t a_2 = d_2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex30-5.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.5.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Labeled bipointed object</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">What strikes me as special about our bipointed object here is that it provides a one-to-one correspondence between "dots" and "arrows". We know we can’t have a retraction from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> because there’s no retraction from a 2-point space to a 1-point space, but we can start building a common section. Let’s call this map <span class="process-math">\(i:S \longrightarrow \mathbf{1}\)</span> and define it such that <span class="process-math">\(i d_1 = i d_2 = d_0\text{.}\)</span>  The existence of this common section establishes that we have a <em class="emphasis">reflexive graph</em>. In Exercise 16, we proved that in a reflexive graph <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> is both determined by <span class="process-math">\(f_A\)</span> and implies that there’s an arrow forming a "self-loop" at each point.</div> <div class="para">Conceptually this makes sense for finite sets.  If I know I have at least one arrow at each point, then I should be able to follow them.  If I have some set of arrows <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and some set of dots <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> describing a map <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> then there can’t be more dots in the image of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> than there were arrows in the source space.</div> <div class="para">There’s precisely one possible endomap on the space <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> and that’s the identity map.  In order for some <span class="process-math">\(f: \mathbf{1} \longrightarrow S\)</span> to preserve the structure of this endomap, we’d necessarily need to have <span class="process-math">\(t' f_A = s' f_A\text{.}\)</span> As a result of our category’s structure preservation, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(f_D \circ t = f_D \circ s\)</span> which our  result in Exercise 25 showed to imply that <span class="process-math">\(f_A\)</span> maps every arrow in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to a loop in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">At this point I feel like I’m starting to talk myself in circles, so I’ll take that a clue to move on to the next Session and hope that it helps clear up some of the details.  I feel like I can at least see how the the preceeding Exercises were leading up to this problem, which gives me a bit of encouragement moving forward.</div>
