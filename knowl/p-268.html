<div class="para">Upon reading this problem, it sounded very similar to one of the situations in the "zoo" from Session 4.  Specifically, I was thinking of the map in Exercise 3 Item (c) where <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> is given by <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^2\text{.}\)</span> On closer inspection, my notes from that section indicate that this <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> had a section but no retraction -- which is the reverse of what I'm looking for here. I played around with item (a) from the zoo for a bit, but I wasn't quite happy with how the domains and codomains weren't aligning.  This got me thinking about a clue at the end of Session 9.  Specifically, the authors mention "Georg Cantor" by name.</div>
