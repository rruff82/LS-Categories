<div class="para">As I’m still trying to force myself to slow down, my plan for time being is to take the quiz this week and self-grade my own work next week before attempting the "test" the week after. I feel as though posting test solutions online would be poor form, so I think I’m going to put my test solutions in a separate PretextBook that can be shared on a per person basis to anyone that’s willing to help determine the correctness of my work.  We’ll see how that goes in the future, but for now we focus on the problems at hand.</div>
