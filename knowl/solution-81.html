<div class="para">I'm thinking that the map <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}\)</span> is the same as the one we used in Exercise 7.  Previously we showed that "multiplying by 5" was not an invertable operation on the integers because the reverse operation of "dividing by 5" is not defined on the same domain.  Now it looks like we're planning to sidestep that issue by inserting our map in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> instead.</div> <div class="para">Let's consider a trivial insertion of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{Q}\)</span> where we simply define <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x\text{.}\)</span> I guess more specifically, we assign each integer <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z} \mathbb{Z}\)</span> to the rational number <span class="process-math">\(\frac{z}{1} \in \mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)</span>  In order for this to be a valid <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{S}^{\circlearrowright}\)</span>-map, then we'd need <span class="process-math">\(\boxed{\mathbb{Z}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}} 
\xrightarrow{f} 
\boxed{\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}}\)</span> to satisfy the equation <span class="process-math">\(f \circ (5 \times ()) = (5 \times ()) \circ f\text{.}\)</span>  This follows directly from commutative property of multiplication: <span class="process-math">\(x \times 5 = 5 \times x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since we've already established that we're working with an endomap on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{,}\)</span> to show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}\)</span> is an "automorphism" we just need to show it has an inverse.  The inverse function would be given by the map <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5} \times ()\text{.}\)</span>  For any <span class="process-math">\(q \in \mathbb{Q}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5} \times 5 \times q = q = 5 \times \frac{1}{5} \times q\text{.}\)</span>  It follows that since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}^{\circlearrowright 5 \times ()}\)</span> is both an endomap and invertable, it meets the definition of an automorphism.</div> <div class="para">All that's left is to prove our map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">injective</em>.  For any pair <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z_1} \mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{z_2} \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f z_1 = f z_2\text{,}\)</span> our choice of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> implies this statement is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(\frac{z_1}{1} = z_1 = z_2 = \frac{z_2}{1}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Another way to think of this would be that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is injective when it has a <em class="emphasis">retraction</em>.  In this case, the map <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q} \xrightarrow{r} \mathbb{Z}\)</span> given by <span class="process-math">\(r(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor\)</span> meets this condition.  For any <span class="process-math">\(z \in \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r f z = r \frac{z}{1} = \lfloor \frac{z}{1} \rfloor = z\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(r \circ f = 1_{\mathbb{Z}}\text{.}\)</span>
