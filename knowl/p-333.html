<div class="para">Maybe "you" lived your entire life in Buffalo such that your <span class="process-math">\(y t = p_0 \forall t \in I_t\text{,}\)</span> our meeting place would be at the start of of my trip or some time prior! In the other extreme, maybe you’ve lived your entire life in Rochester and your <span class="process-math">\(y t = p_1 \forall t \in I_t\text{.}\)</span> In this case, "you meeting me" is contigent on "me deciding to make the trip" and we "meet" at 5:00pm.  It’s also possible you’ve never been to either Buffalo nor Rochester but live some place along the way, or maybe have been to one but not the other.  In any of these cases, we can can map your position to some sub-interval of <span class="process-math">\(I_p\)</span> for the entire time period <span class="process-math">\(I_t\text{.}\)</span>
