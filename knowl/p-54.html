<div class="para">I was thinking about a "map" like I would a "function" in a program.  In this analogy I had interpreted "domain" as my "input type" and "codomain" as "output type".  The flaw in this reasoning is that I was allowing "functions" to "error", which is not true under the definitions of "map" and "domain" that were presented.  If the map <span class="process-math">\(f(J)\)</span> produced something "undefined", it would be inaccurate to include <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to begin with.</div>
