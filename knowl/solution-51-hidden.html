<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">I chose <em class="emphasis">could be different from</em> in both cases.  In the "Composition of opposed maps" on the previous page they use the maps <span class="process-math">\(g = mother\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f = father\)</span> as an example.  With those definitions, <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g \circ f(me)\)</span> would be "the father of my paternal grandmother" which is clearly a different person than "my father" <span class="process-math">\(f(me)\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g \circ f \neq f\text{.}\)</span>  Likewise, the map <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g\)</span> would be like a relation of "maternal grandfather".  Clearly the "maternal grandfather of my maternal grandfather" described by <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g \circ f \circ g(me)\)</span> would be a different person than "my maternal grandfather" <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g(me)\text{.}\)</span> Since we only need one counter-example to prove maps different, <em class="emphasis">QED</em>.</div></div></body>
