<div class="para">Story time! I'm chilling in Buffalo on a Friday morning when I get a call from a friend and decide to take a road trip to Rochester to vist them. So at noon, I jump in the car and start heading there, but I remember I left my wallet! I bust a U and go back home to look for it.  By the time I find it, my tummy is growling. I head over my favorite taqueria for a bite.  It's a little out of my way, but the salsa is to die for.  I finally get on the road again, but now everyone is getting out of work so I hit some nasty traffic on the way.  After crawling along a snail's pace for a few hours I'm starting to get tired and need to use the restroom.  I make a quick detour to a little cafe I just passed.  By the time I'm back on the road again, traffic has cleared up and it's a straight shot to Rochester at 5:00pm. My trip might look something like this:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session10-ex4-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.13.9<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Sample map corresponding to "my" story</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Okay, maybe I got carried away, but this is "my" story.  It has a beginning, in Buffalo at noon and it has an end, in Rochester at 5:00pm.  In the figure above, the horizontal axis is the time in hours since my departure, and the vertical axis in the distance in miles along the road.  Note that in my story, I double back for tacos, which is why there's a section in the map with negative distance.  "Your" story might be a little different, but what I do know is that you were "somewhere on the road between Buffalo and Rochester" for the entire duration.  For now, let's suppose you just drive back a forth along some stretch of road in the middle like so:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session10-ex4-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.13.10<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Sample map corresponding to "your" story</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">It should be obvious in this case that our paths have to cross, but we're trying to generalize these maps as much as possible.  For now, let's start giving some of these objects proper names.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(E_t = \{t_0,t_1\}\)</span> be our start time and end time for "endpoints" of the trip in "time".  Let <span class="process-math">\(E_p = \{p_0,p_1\}\)</span> be Buffalo and Rochester, our "endpoints" on the "road".  Since both time and space are continuous, these endpoints can be included in the respective intervals <span class="process-math">\(I_t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I_p\text{.}\)</span> Let's call the inclusion map on the "time"-line to be <span class="process-math">\(j_t : E_t \longrightarrow I_t\)</span> and the inclusion map on the "position"-line to be <span class="process-math">\(j_p : E_p \longrightarrow I_p\text{.}\)</span> Note that Brouwer's 1st Theorem says there can't exist any retractions for either of these maps.</div> <div class="para">My position at any given time is a map <span class="process-math">\(m: I_t \longrightarrow I_p\)</span> that needs to satisfy certain conditions.  I know <span class="process-math">\(m(t_0)=p_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m(t_1)=p_1\text{:}\)</span> that at the start of my trip I'm in Buffalo and at the end I'm in Rochester.  Note that since our endpoints are included: <span class="process-math">\(m j_t = j_p\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The premise of this thought experiment is based around the idea that if "you" also have a map <span class="process-math">\(y: I_t \longrightarrow I_p\)</span> we must necessarily meet somewhere in that "space-time".  We're using some kind of "freeway distance", where my 'location' sticks to the exit I took off it when I needed to make a stop.</div> <div class="para">Maybe "you" lived your entire life in Buffalo such that your <span class="process-math">\(y t = p_0 \forall t \in I_t\text{,}\)</span> our meeting place would be at the start of of my trip or some time prior! In the other extreme, maybe you've lived your entire life in Rochester and your <span class="process-math">\(y t = p_1 \forall t \in I_t\text{.}\)</span> In this case, "you meeting me" is contigent on "me deciding to make the trip" and we "meet" at 5:00pm.  It's also possible you've never been to either Buffalo nor Rochester but live some place along the way, or maybe have been to one but not the other.  In any of these cases, we can can map your position to some sub-interval of <span class="process-math">\(I_p\)</span> for the entire time period <span class="process-math">\(I_t\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">What I'm going to argue is that if you have such a map and we <em class="emphasis">never meet</em> we can construct a continuous retraction from <span class="process-math">\(r: I \longrightarrow E\)</span> with no fixed point.  Since Brouwer's theorem establishes that such a retraction can't exist, there must be some <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf(1) \xrightarrow(x) I_t\)</span> with the property <span class="process-math">\(m x = y x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">First, let's rule out the "easy maps".  Suppose I hadn't doubled back at all and moved steadily from Buffalo to Rochester so that my path is invertable — I have a unique position for every time. We'd be able to use your map construct endomap on <span class="process-math">\(I_t\)</span> through the composition given by <span class="process-math">\(I_t \xrightarrow{y} I_p \xrightarrow{m^{-1}} I_t\text{.}\)</span>  Our fixed point theorem says any continuous endomap has a fixed point, so there's some <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\((m^(-1) \circ y) x = x\text{.}\)</span>  Apply <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> on the left side to get <span class="process-math">\(m \circ (m^(-1) \circ y) x = y x = m x\text{.}\)</span>   We meet at time <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and position <span class="process-math">\(y x = m x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">What if your map is invertable?  Well, then we could use it to construct an endomap on <span class="process-math">\(I_p\text{.}\)</span> We compose <span class="process-math">\(I_p \xrightarrow{y^{-1}} I_t \xrightarrow{m} I_p\text{.}\)</span>  This implies there's some fixed point <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} I_p\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\((m \circ y^{-1}) x = x\text{.}\)</span>  Note that our spaces are different, so here we meet at time <span class="process-math">\(y^{-1} x\)</span> and position <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">There is however, one map that might have the property <span class="process-math">\(m x = y x \forall t \in I_t\text{.}\)</span>  Imagine my "evil twin".  This twin starts in the opposite city and takes the opposite that I do along the way. If <span class="process-math">\(any\)</span> map is going to avoid coming into contact with me at every step in my journey, it would have to be him.  He takes every step I do, but in the opposite direction!  This is the composition of my map with the "antipodal map" on <span class="process-math">\(I_t\)</span>— it takes every moment in my journey in reverse. If my map is continuous, so is my evil twin.  If there's a sequence of arrows, we can reverse them.</div> <div class="para">We've already established that my journey is not invertable, so it stands to reason that my evil twin would also have that property. But check this out, even me and my evil twin need to meet!</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session10-ex4-3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.13.11<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>My "evil twin" map</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">The composition of the antipodal map <span class="process-math">\(a_t\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(I_t\)</span> followed my <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> must be the same as <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> followed by the antipodal map <span class="process-math">\(a_p\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(I_p\text{.}\)</span>  My trip needs to be reversable, but we've already shown that it can't be.  The fixed point theorem says me and my evil twin have to either meet or jump over each other — the map can't be continuous without the meet-up!</div> <div class="para">I'm thinking that we can use the meeting place of myself and my evil twin as an approximation for the midpoint of my journey.  Your map needs to have some evil twin midpoint also. If we alternate "halfway points", we should be able to do something of a binary search to home in on each other's location in terms of whether we're closer in the front or back half of our respective trips.  Essentially, we'd have an analogue for the <em class="emphasis">mean value theorem</em>.</div> <div class="para">I think this is about as close as I'm going to get for "an answer" to (a) and (b) for the week. I'm not really sure how I would generalize it further for (c) and (d).  I feel like right now there's a glaring weak spot in my argument by even assuming <span class="process-math">\(y: I_t \longrightarrow I_p\)</span> is well-defined for the entire space.  What if "you" were born or died sometime during my trip? Would I still necessarily "meet" you?</div> <div class="para">The thing that I'm left curious is about the connection between Brouwer's theorems and my notions about simplices. I'm used to this idea of going from a point <span class="process-math">\(S_0\text{,}\)</span> to a line segment <span class="process-math">\(S_1\text{,}\)</span> to a triangle <span class="process-math">\(S_2\text{,}\)</span> to a tetrahedra <span class="process-math">\(S_3\text{,}\)</span> and then generalizing to higher dimensional spaces <span class="process-math">\(S_n\)</span> from there.  There seems like an obvious parallel to Brouwer's first theorem that says we can't have a retraction from <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(S_0\text{,}\)</span> or from any <span class="process-math">\(S_n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(S_m\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(m \leq n\)</span> for that matter.</div>
