<div class="para">I think the key idea in part (a) here is that the point <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> precisely satisfies the properties we want for establishing the existence of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span>  As long as there is some map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f = h\)</span> then we can define <span class="process-math">\(b = f(a)\)</span> and it follows directly that <span class="process-math">\(h(a) = (g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Proving the converse in (b) seems a little trickier.  I think I’d want to approach this like I did with "Exercise 1" and consider making an image by applying <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> to each element <span class="process-math">\(b_1,b_2,... \in \mathbf{1} \longrightarrow B\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If we already know that for each <span class="process-math">\(gb_i\)</span> there is at least one <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(ha_i = gb_i\text{,}\)</span> we can begin to construct a map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by creating a collection of arrows with origin <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span> and destination <span class="process-math">\(b_i\text{.}\)</span>
