<div class="para">Since we're guaranteed to have <span class="process-math">\(r(x) \in C\text{,}\)</span> let's see what happens when we compose <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> with it. If we could prove <span class="process-math">\(r \circ j = 1_C\text{,}\)</span> we'd have a contradiction and be done, but it's not clear that's the case quite yet. I think the key to this lies in the fact that <span class="process-math">\(g \circ j = j\text{.}\)</span>  In the text, they proved the special case where <span class="process-math">\(g = 1_D\text{.}\)</span>  This is a slightly more relaxation condition to show that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> doesn't need to be the identity everywhere â€” it just needs to be the identity on the edge of the disk where it meets the circle.</div>
