<div class="para">If any map on this interval was going to "have no fixed point", it would have needed to be an antipodal map. In order for any map <span class="process-math">\(r: I \longrightarrow E\)</span> to possibly satisfy <span class="process-math">\(r \circ j = 1_E\text{,}\)</span> it needs to divide the points into two sections. Our map either needs to map "0.5" to itself or to leave it undefined altogther. If we have arrows going from 0 to 1 and arrows from 1 to 0, at some point along the way the "heads" of our arrows need to go past the "tails" coming from the opposite direction.</div>
