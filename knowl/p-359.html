<div class="para">Maybe it might help to think of taking a map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> applying and taking an "image" of it for every <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \xrightarrow{x} A \xrightarrow{f} \text{Image}_f(A)\text{.}\)</span> Either we find some point <span class="process-math">\(f x = x\)</span> or we don't, but we can use this to classify each point as "fixed" or "not".  Essentially this process defines map <span class="process-math">\(g: A \longrightarrow\{0,1\}\)</span> that returns <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> if a point is fixed by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> if it doesn't.  However, since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is known to be an involution with <span class="process-math">\(f \circ f = 1_A\)</span> then there needs to be at least as many points in <span class="process-math">\(\text{Image}_f(A)\)</span> as there are in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> which ensures that <span class="process-math">\(\text{Image}_f(A) = A\text{.}\)</span>
