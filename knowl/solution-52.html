<div class="para">I think the first time I attempted this I made a mistake in problem 1(b).  Looking over my notes, it seems like I was still confused about the definition of <em class="emphasis">idempotent</em>.  Rather than coming up with a endomap <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> that satisfied <span class="process-math">\(e \circ e = e\text{,}\)</span> I seem to have constructed one where <span class="process-math">\(e \circ e = 1_A\text{.}\)</span>  As a result of using an <em class="emphasis">involution</em> instead, I was justifiably having a hard time showing the properties in part (c).  This defintion actually appears on the page adjacent to the test with a note to "see Article III", so I'd expect that this was a common mistake made by students while in development.</div>
