<div class="para">I think this is about as close as I'm going to get for "an answer" to (a) and (b) for the week. I'm not really sure how I would generalize it further for (c) and (d).  I feel like right now there's a glaring weak spot in my argument by even assuming <span class="process-math">\(y: I_t \longrightarrow I_p\)</span> is well-defined for the entire space.  What if "you" were born or died sometime during my trip? Would I still necessarily "meet" you?</div>
