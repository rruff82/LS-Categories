<div class="para">This week I worked through Test 1, and honestly, it wasn’t half as hard as I remembered it being the first time I attempted it.  I even managed to dig out my original attempt for comparison and I’m much more confident in my new solutions than the old ones.  Even though it was easier than expected, I feel uneasy about sharing "test solutions" too widely.  I do think it’s fair to reflect on the mistake I made though.</div>
