<div class="para">Let’s recap the last exercise:  Given "A is a retract of X" (<span class="process-math">\(\exists A \mathrel{\substack{s \\[-0.6ex]
\textstyle\longrightarrow \\[-0.6ex]
\textstyle\longleftarrow \\[-0.6ex]
r}} X \text{such that} r \circ s = 1_A\)</span>) and "X has the fixed point property for maps from T" ( <span class="process-math">\(\forall X \xrightarrow{f} X: \exists T \xrightarrow{x} X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x\)</span>), it follows that "A also has the fixed point property" ( <span class="process-math">\(\forall A \xrightarrow{g} A: \exists T \xrightarrow{y} A\)</span> such that<span class="process-math">\(g(y) = y\)</span>).</div> <div class="para">In the case of theorem (1), we can assume the premise "Let <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> be a line segment including its endpoints (<span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> for Interval) and suppose <span class="process-math">\(f: I \longrightarrow I\)</span> is a continuous endomap.  Then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must have a fixed point: a point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x\text{.}\)</span>"</div> <div class="para">We’re attempting to show that this is sufficient to imply the corresponding retraction theorem: "Consider the inclusion map <span class="process-math">\(j: E \longrightarrow I\)</span> of the two-point set <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> as boundary of the interval <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span>  There is no continuous map which is a retraction for j."</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a two-point set, perhaps we can use the fact that there are only four possible endomaps that can exist in that space. These are illustrated below:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session10-ex3-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.13.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Possible endomaps on two point space</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Of these four maps, precisely one has the property of "having no fixed point".  This <em class="emphasis">antipodal</em> map sends each of the points in <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> to the "opposite" point.  For the sake of convenience, let’s can name these points <span class="process-math">\(E = {0, 1}\text{.}\)</span>  The antipodal map <span class="process-math">\(E \xrightarrow{a} E\)</span> is equivalent to the operation <span class="process-math">\(a(x) = 1 - x\text{,}\)</span> with the other maps being given by <span class="process-math">\(1_A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \{0\}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1} \rightarrow \{1\}\text{.}\)</span> This is the unique endomap on <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(a \circ a = 1_A\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I’m thinking the easiest way to approach this is to assume we have some map <span class="process-math">\(I \xrightarrow{f} I\)</span> that acts like our "antipodal" map sending each point to it’s mirror on the other half of the interval. For us to have any notion of continuity on this interval, we’d need to be able to take an arbitrarily small step to one side of each endpoint so we should be able to take the opposite step from the other.  In other words, for any <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\text{,}\)</span> we can pair <span class="process-math">\(0+\epsilon\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1-\epsilon\text{.}\)</span> Using the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a(x) = 1 - x\)</span> as this operation, it’s easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> produces a fixed point in the middle at <span class="process-math">\(x=0.5\)</span> where it’s equidistantant from the endpoints <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If any map on this interval was going to "have no fixed point", it would have needed to be an antipodal map. In order for any map <span class="process-math">\(r: I \longrightarrow E\)</span> to possibly satisfy <span class="process-math">\(r \circ j = 1_E\text{,}\)</span> it needs to divide the points into two sections. Our map either needs to map "0.5" to itself or to leave it undefined altogther. If we have arrows going from 0 to 1 and arrows from 1 to 0, at some point along the way the "heads" of our arrows need to go past the "tails" coming from the opposite direction.</div> <div class="para">Perhaps this makes more sense if I step back a bit and state something "obvious": <em class="emphasis">There is no retraction from <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\text{.}\)</span></em> <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> has two points while <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> has one.  <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> <em class="emphasis">might</em> have a section, in which case we have one of the two bottom diagrams in the possible endomaps figure above.  This would be our map that takes the fixed point and sends it to itself. We can go from <span class="process-math">\(1 
\longrightarrow E \longrightarrow 1\text{,}\)</span> but we make <span class="process-math">\(1_E\)</span> by going from <span class="process-math">\(E \longrightarrow 1 
\longrightarrow E\)</span> because there simply aren’t enough points to work with.</div> <div class="para">It sounds like a variation of the intermediate value theorem. If there’s a path of arrows leading from 0 to 1, then we should be able to reverse it and follow the arrows from 1 to 0.  When we do, either there needs to be some fixed point that connects the heads from one path to the tails from the other or we don’t have a continuous path —we jump!</div> <div class="para">In summary:</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">The only endomap on <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> with no fixed point is the antipodal map.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The only endomap on <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> that could potentially not have a fixed point would be the antipodal map.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The antipodal map on <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> has a fixed point.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There is no endomap on <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> without fixed point.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Any retract preserves fixed points.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There is no retract from <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span>
</div></li>
</ol> <div class="para">If it sounds like I’m unsure at this point, that’s because I am. Maybe attempting the second theorem will provide more insight.</div> <div class="para">For (2) we’re given that any continuous endomap on the closed disk, <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> must have a fixed point.  We want to prove that there is no continuous map which is a retraction for the inclusion map <span class="process-math">\(j : C \longrightarrow D\)</span> of the circle into the disk.</div> <div class="para">I think we can develop a similar definition of an "antipodal map" on the circle by reflecting across the center of the disk.  This map <span class="process-math">\(C \xrightarrow{a} C\)</span> is a unique endomap on <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> It has no fixed points for the circle — <span class="process-math">\(\forall x 
\in C: a(x) \neq x\)</span> —  and acts as it’s own inverse —  <span class="process-math">\(a \circ a = 1_C\text{.}\)</span>  We can extend this map to the disk, but it fails to provide an inverse for the point at the center which we reflected over.  Our antipodal map is the only possible section of the disk’s boundary, but it fails to be a retraction due to this "missing" point in the middle.</div> <div class="para">A similar line of reasoning should hold true for the sphere.  The antipodal map reflects each point on the sphere across the center to the opposite side.  It’s the only possible section that doesn’t fix any points on the sphere, but then any corresponding retraction on the ball would be missing the center or have a fixed point there.</div> <div class="para">After all that, I’m still a little uncertain about this.  I’m not convinced my proof is correct, but I also won’t find out one way or the other unless I keep moving. So, on we go.</div>
