<div class="para">By looking at my "camera" in the higher dimensional space <span class="process-math">\(S \times T\)</span> I can think of it as an "endomap".  There’s only one detail which needs to be worked out, and that’s the fact that my original map had 16 arrows to go with each of the <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4 = 16\)</span> "dots", we’ve now added in the 4 additional dots from our temperature space <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>  For us to have a well-defined endmap, these dots would need to have arrows also. It seems natural that I’d want these new arrows to "loop".</div>
