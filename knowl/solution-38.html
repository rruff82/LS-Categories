<div class="para">The first thing that jumps out at me about the bracket is that the sums of the adjacent ranks are constant:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session7-a3-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

However, the fun doesn't stop there.</div> <div class="para">The bracket also appears to balance "skill gap" between the top half and the bottom half.  The winner of the match-up with the highest rank differential goes on to face the winner of the match with the lowest differential in the next round.  Those differentials sum to a constant much like the ranks did.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session7-a3-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

The four player one is easy, since it's essentially embeeded in the original.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session7-a3-3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.7.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>4 player bracket</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">To make the 16 player bracket, I'm going to start by pairing off players based on rank: The player in rank 1 should be paired with the player in rank 16, rank 2 with rank 15, rank 3 with rank 14, and so on until all 8 pairs have been assigned.  Since these pairings go from largest score differential to smallest, we can assign the pairs to each of the "ranks" in the 8 player bracket to extend it further.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session7-a3-4.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.7.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>16 player bracket</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">This works out nicely because if the top 8 players all win their match-ups in the first round of the 16-player bracket, they'd wind up in a bracket that is basically identical to their placement in the 8-player bracket. Likewise, if the top four players continue to win then we end up in a situation identical to the 4-player bracket. It has a nice recursively defined structure.</div>
