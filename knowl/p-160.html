<div class="para">The map in (b) and the map in (c) are both closely related because they share a common definition of <span class="process-math">\(sq(x) = x^2\text{,}\)</span> but the domain and codomain.  Again there's an obvious inverse function of "square root", but the domains and codomains are what concern me.  Notable about (b) is that it fails to map "onto" the entire codomain, because the <span class="process-math">\(sq\)</span> map never produces any negative numbers as an output.  The map in (c) resolves this by limiting the codomain to non-negative values, but it still fails to "one-to-one" because both 1 and -1 produce an output of 1.</div>
