<div class="para">To be honest, I wasn’t quite sure how to start this one at first so I just started exploring small endomaps. I explored too many to review them all, but in the process I learned some things.</div> <div class="para">I think I had conceptually confused <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_A\)</span> at first. I was under the impression that <span class="process-math">\(f_A\)</span> "produced an arrow" and <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> "produced a dot", but a closer reading of the book stated that <span class="process-math">\(f_A\)</span> "operates on arrows" and <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> "operates on dots". Eventually I made a mental shift to the Spanish <span class="process-math">\(antes\)</span> (before) and <span class="process-math">\(despues\)</span> (after) because it helped me remember the relationship with the endomaps.</div> <div class="para">I found tables to be a nice way of organizing all the information about my "arrows" and "dots".  Having my information organized reminded me of Exercise 10.  Looking back over my notes, I had noticed earlier that the diagram included a pair of two different arrows with the same source and destination.  I took this as a hint.</div> <div class="para">I  also found myself repeatedly going back to the map in Example 9 as a reference.  There was something about the way the endomap removes an element that seemed like it might be important.  I labeled the arrows in addition to the points to help keep track of what I was working with:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex14-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

I wasn’t sure if I needed to enforce this restriction on that all arrows in my endomaps were loops or not.  I started to wonder how much of this ambiguity was intentional, and if looser of a definition of "loop" might be in order.</div> <div class="para">A flash of insight came as I was trying to pick out a cat photo for the week and see Alphonse nuzzling Konshu:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/al-konshu-nuzzle.png" class="contained" alt="A brown tabby lays in a blue cat bed and nuzzles a small figure depicting the Egyptian deity Konshu."></div>

I wondered how my mental model of Konshu might vary depending on which version I encountered first.  To appease my "fussy professor", I’m going to define my set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to be the set of "Konshu Models" <span class="process-math">\(\{\text{Comic Konshu},\text{Myth Konshu},\text{My Konshu}\}\)</span> and endomap <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> to be the "influences" acting on those models.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex14-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

Whether those projections align with the mythology will impact the design of later comics, forming a sort of feedback loop.  Prior to seeing the Netflix show, my model of Konshu isn’t really impacted by either — I’m just off in my own little world.</div> <div class="para">Now let’s denote <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to be a map describing how my metal model might change after exposure to new ideas. Maybe seeing the Netflix show prompts me to read a bunch of comics or mythology.  In either case, it forms a feedback loop between my model of the comic Konshu and my model of the myth Konshu.

</div> <div class="para">I’m thinking that the moral of the story here is these endomaps contain more than self-loops, but our insertion <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> fails to enforce that condition.  If the endomap contains only self loops it has an insertion that makes a commutative diagram, but just because we have a commutative diagram like this doesn’t mean it came from that insertion.</div>
