<div class="para">Upon reading this problem, it sounded very similar to one of the situations in the "zoo" from Session 4.  Specifically, I was thinking of the map in Exercise 3 Item (c) where <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> is given by <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^2\text{.}\)</span> On closer inspection, my notes from that section indicate that this <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> had a section but no retraction -- which is the reverse of what I'm looking for here. I played around with item (a) from the zoo for a bit, but I wasn't quite happy with how the domains and codomains weren't aligning.  This got me thinking about a clue at the end of Session 9.  Specifically, the authors mention "Georg Cantor" by name.</div> <div class="para">With the realization that I could use infinite sets of varying sizes, I decided that I could combine this notion with the ideas behind the set sizes in Problem 1 by making a map from a "countably infinite set" to an "uncountably infinite set".  In this situation, I could theoretically use Cantor's diagonalization argument to prove the non-existance of my section.</div> <div class="para">I decided to use a "binary representation" map <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^+ \xrightarrow{f} (0,1)\)</span> that takes each positive integer and turns it into a binary representation of a real number between 0 and 1 by prepending "0." to the reversed binary representation of the integer.  Like so:</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.10.8<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">We can construct a map <span class="process-math">\((0,1) \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> that iterates along the digits of the input and sums up the product of that digit with the respective powers of 2.  For example, <span class="process-math">\(g(0.01001)\)</span> could be evaluated as follows:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
g(0.01001) = 0 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^1 +  0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^4
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">Assuming we started with some positive integer and applied <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to it, it would be in the table above and this map <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will return the number we started with.  Thus we have a well defined retraction becaues <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f = 1_{\mathbb{Z}^+}\text{.}\)</span>  However, Cantor's diagonal argument suggest that there still exists at least one real number in the interval (0,1) for which there is no inverse.  Consider the real number constructed by taking a single "bit" from each line of the table following the diagonal and flipping it while adding trailing zeroes to the right as needed:</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.10.9<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">By concatenating all these flipped bits together we can constuct a number <span class="process-math">\(y \in (0,1)\)</span> given by the binary expansion "0.0011..." as defined above. This number doesn't have a corresponding <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value in the table for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> because it differs from every output by at least one bit.
