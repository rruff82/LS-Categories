<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.6.18<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Graph <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> for Session 11 Exercise 8</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">For (a), we’re given a map of graphs <span class="process-math">\(G \xrightarrow{f} J\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(fb = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(fe = 1\text{.}\)</span>  We want to show that there is no path in G that begins at <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and ends at <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> produces both points in <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> it must be surjective, having a section <span class="process-math">\(J \xrightarrow{s} G\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f s = 1_J\text{.}\)</span>  This map <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is determined by <span class="process-math">\(s0 = b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s1 = e\text{.}\)</span>  We can then use this map to build an endomap <span class="process-math">\(G \xrightarrow{\alpha} G\)</span> by composing <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> in the reverse order: <span class="process-math">\(\alpha = s f\text{.}\)</span>  Note that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha b = s f b = s 0 = b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\alpha e = s f e = s 1 = e\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> has at least two fixed points.  Further note that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is idempotent since <span class="process-math">\(\alpha^2 = s f s f = s 1_J f = 
s f = \alpha\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Suppose there was such a path from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> We could think of this path as another "endomap" on some subset of the dots <span class="process-math">\(P \subset G\)</span> on our graph forming our "path". We can identify some <span class="process-math">\(P \xrightarrow{\beta} P\)</span> with the propery that each application of map takes us one step along that path from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> until we arrive and stay there. In otherwords, we have a sequence of points <span class="process-math">\(b \rightarrow \beta b
\rightarrow \beta^2 b \rightarrow ... \rightarrow \beta^n b = e\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of nodes we traverse. We can also use this to define a reverse path by swapping the source and target of each arrow to produce an inverse map <span class="process-math">\(\beta^{-1}\)</span> that traverses these points in the opposite order: <span class="process-math">\(e \rightarrow \beta^{-1} e \rightarrow
\beta^{-2} e \rightarrow ... \rightarrow \beta^{-n} e = b\text{.}\)</span> However, note that the arrows of <span class="process-math">\(\beta^{-1}\)</span> might not necessarily exist in the original graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Consider what happens when we apply <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> to these points in the path.  For <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to preserve structure, we need to have <span class="process-math">\(f \alpha = \beta f\text{.}\)</span>  But since <span class="process-math">\(\alpha = s f\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(f \alpha = f s f = 1_J f = f\)</span> which implies <span class="process-math">\(\beta = 1_J\)</span> for all points in our path.  In otherwords, any point accessible from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must get mapped to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I imagine this process to be something like "coloring the graph". We can start at point <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and paint it "blue", then follow each arrow leading out of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and paint those points "blue" as well. At the same time, we can start at point <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> and paint it "red" but this time we take the arrows with a target of <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> and paint the point at the source "red".  If we repeating the process as many times as we’re able we’ll eventually get a "purple" point or arrow if the paths do in fact connect.</div> <div class="para">To get a feel for this, let’s try it with the example graph on the same page:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 95%; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 2.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session11-ex8-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.6.19<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Sample graph to illustrate path coloring</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Coloring the figure like this is a lot of work, but having done so makes it clear that there is no possible path between <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in this diagram.  The dashed arrows show edges that were neither transversed forward from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> nor backwards from <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> Both of these paths formed closed loops.  We’re unable to connect the two loops without an arrow with a red source and blue destination.</div> <div class="para">Consider the commutative diagram of our endomap <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> on the subset of points forming our path <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must preserve structure, we want <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = \gamma J\)</span> for any endomap <span class="process-math">\(J \xrightarrow{\gamma} J\text{.}\)</span>

If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma = 1_J\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = 1_J f = f\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(\beta = 1_P\)</span>  which contradicts our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(\beta^n b = e \neq b\text{.}\)</span>   If <span class="process-math">\(\forall j \in J: \gamma j = 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = \gamma f\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(f \beta p = 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(p \in P\)</span> which contradicts <span class="process-math">\(f e = 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I see a lot of similarity here with the Brouwer’s Theorems indroduced earlier.  Essentially, by thinking of the path as an endomap we need to have a "fixed point" or we can’t have a "retraction at the boundary".</div> <div class="para">For (b) we need to prove the converse.  Suppose we have some path from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P \subset G\text{.}\)</span>  If we think of that path as an endomap <span class="process-math">\(\beta: P \rightarrow P\)</span> as described above, then that endomap must have a fixed point <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> *somewhere*. That point obviously can’t be <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(\beta b = b\)</span> contradicts our notion of a path.  Likewise, it couldn’t fix any <span class="process-math">\(\beta^n b\)</span> along the path either, so the only reasonable fixed point would be <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span>  As before, <span class="process-math">\(P^{\circlearrowright \beta} \xrightarrow{f} J^{\circlearrowright \gamma}\)</span> would need to preserve the structure of both possible endomaps on <span class="process-math">\(J\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma = 1_J\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = \gamma f = f\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(\beta = 1_P\)</span> which contradicts <span class="process-math">\(\beta b \neq b\text{.}\)</span>  If <span class="process-math">\(\forall j \in J: \gamma j = 0\)</span> , then that contradicts our condition that <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = \gamma f\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(f \beta e = f e = 1\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\gamma f e = \gamma 1 = 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">In other words, the existence of an intermediate point in this path prevents us from having a retraction at the boundary because we know there’s we can’t possibly have retraction to a map from a 3-point space to a two point space.  It follows that the endomap describing our path must have a fixed point, but we can’t have a fixed point in the path or we’ll never reach our destination.</div>
