<div class="para">After reading through this session, I noticed something very interesting about the last diagram. I’ll recreate it here for reference.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-session6-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.6.2<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>The last diagram in L&amp;S Session 6</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">What struck me as interesting about this map was how closely it described <em class="emphasis">a book</em>.  There’s only a finite number of "words" in the "language" that the book is written using, and we can index them with positive integers describing their sequence in the book.</div> <div class="para">This observation struck me as interesting because my reading of this book works the same as the sampling process.  You could generate a map from time to the index of the word that I’m reading at the time, and compose this map with the book map to find out what word I’m reading.  This would reveal my non-linear path through the book, rereading sections as needed to answer the problems I’m working on.</div> <div class="para">It makes me wonder if this session is actually an exercise in <em class="emphasis">meta-mathematics</em>. Maybe the reason the authors intended to sow seeds of curiousity about their ommission and for me look at the book as a system that can be studied using category theory itself. The chapters of the book act as a <em class="emphasis">sort</em> for the exercises, but the fact that this chapter doesn’t exercises have any means it’s not a <em class="emphasis">partition</em>.</div> <div class="para">I think it’s kind of funny that this section of the book about sections would be a counter-example to the book’s exercises having a section.</div>
