Any isomorphism <span class="process-math">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span> will need to map <span class="process-math">\(a_0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b_0\)</span> to preserve the in/out arrow counts at each point.</div> <div class="para">The remaining 3 points all have 1 arrow in and 1 arrow out. However, the left diagram has 2 paths leading up and 1 leading down while the right diagram has 2 paths leading down and 1 leading up.  Knowing that we’ve flipped the diagram vertically, we’d need to match the path down in the left diagram with the path up it the right diagram — pairing point <span class="process-math">\(a_1\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(b_4\text{.}\)</span> The remaining two points from each figure can be matched up either way without altering the structure.</div> <div class="para">It follows that there are precisely 2 isomorphisms <span class="process-math">\(f_1,f_2\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  Both maps necessirly have <span class="process-math">\(f_n a_0 = b_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f_n a_2 = b_0\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_n a_1 = b_4\text{.}\)</span> Where they differ is how they handle <span class="process-math">\(a_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_4\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f_1 a_3 = b_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_1 a_4 = b_3\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(f_2 a_3 = b_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_2 a_4 = b_1\text{.}\)</span>
