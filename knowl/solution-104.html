Once we have a point <span class="process-math">\(y \in Y^{\circlearrowright \beta}\)</span> we can ask whether or not <span class="process-math">\(\beta y = y\)</span> produces a fixed point. This is a <em class="emphasis">binary</em> question for which the answer either needs to be "true" or "false".  Let’s call this space <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{2} = \{0,1\}\)</span> with the conventions <span class="process-math">\(0 = \text{false}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\beta y = y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 = \text{true}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\beta y \neq y\text{.}\)</span> Let’s define this map as <span class="process-math">\(Y^{\circlearrowright \beta} \xrightarrow{g} \mathbf{2}^{\circlearrowright \gamma}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Obviously such map exists between sets, but the real question is whether or not <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> <em class="emphasis">preserves structure</em> within our category.  There are precisely 4 possible endomaps <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span> we could possibly have: an identity map, an antipodal map, and two idempotents resulting in <span class="process-math">\(0, 1\)</span> respectively.  This allows us to ask further questions, like if <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is has a <em class="emphasis">retraction</em>.  Of the four possible endomaps on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{2}\text{,}\)</span> only the identity map and the antipodal map would even qualify because we know there’s no possible retraction from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">This is all still really fuzzy and I feel like I’m missing something, so I think I’m going to let this information stew for another week and come back to it..</div>
