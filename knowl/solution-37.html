<div class="para">Oooh this is a fun one! Let's presume we meet some alien species and are trying to sync up our timelines.  We're going to need both space and time coordinates if we really want to do this right.  One possibility is for both parties to use "the big bang" as a point of origin and "the light cone" for a direction and magnitude.  This choice makes converting easy, but potentially imprecise because of the sheer size of those values.</div> <div class="para">A much more practical approach would be to use the meeting time and location as a point of origin, use physical constants to communicate SI units, then work backwards to calculate the local time for each party using a Lorentz transformation.  We'd just need to where they came from and how fast they traveled to convert their home civilization's time to their current time.</div> <div class="para">I think the point that the authors were trying to communicate was that our choice of units and magnitude for "time" are very specific to our origin on planet Earth.  If we're talking about units of "years" as being "one orbit around the Sun" and the origin as a socially defined "common era", then an alien race from another plant would likely have totally different system of dating then us.  However, most SI units are based on physical properties of our universe. Even if this species chose a different set of base units than us, we could match up measurements of certain elements to develop an <em class="emphasis">isomorphism</em> between our two systems.</div>
