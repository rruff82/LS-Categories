<div class="para">I'm thinking the easiest way to approach this is to assume we have some map <span class="process-math">\(I \xrightarrow{f} I\)</span> that acts like our "antipodal" map sending each point to it's mirror on the other half of the interval. For us to have any notion of continuity on this interval, we'd need to be able to take an arbitrarily small step to one side of each endpoint so we should be able to take the opposite step from the other.  In other words, for any <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\text{,}\)</span> we can pair <span class="process-math">\(0+\epsilon\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1-\epsilon\text{.}\)</span> Using the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a(x) = 1 - x\)</span> as this operation, it's easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> produces a fixed point in the middle at <span class="process-math">\(x=0.5\)</span> where it's equidistantant from the endpoints <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span>
