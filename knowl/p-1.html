<div class="para">I've been trying to work my way though "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel (herein "L&amp;S") on my own and it's been kind of difficult. Part of the problem is that I don't have any feedback about whether my solutions to exercises are correct or not.  In an effort to resolve this, I've decided to publish my solutions as I go through it so I can discuss them on social media.</div>
