<div class="para">I reasoned that the <em class="emphasis">Moon Knight</em> from the comics used the mythology around Konshu to develop the character, but as more people read the comic they start to project qualities from the comic character back to the deity.  Whether those projections align with the mythology will impact the design of later comics, forming a sort of feedback loop.  Prior to seeing the Netflix show, my model of Konshu isn't really impacted by either â€” I'm just off in my own little world.</div>
