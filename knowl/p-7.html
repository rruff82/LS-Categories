<div class="para">Since I was already thinking about cats in the context of category theory, my first thought was perhaps <span class="process-math">\(BEHAVIOR=NATURE \times NURTURE\)</span> might satisfy the pattern here.  The way my cats seem to behave is based in part on certain natural instincts to hunt and hide, but they have been brought up in an environment where those tendencies manifest as behaviors that we classify as cute and playful. On closer inspection, however, I became a little less confident in this when I tried to identify the "maps".</div>
