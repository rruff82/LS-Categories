<div class="para">Let's break it down one map at time.</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=3x+7\)</span> has a well-defined inverse of <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(x) = (x-7)/3\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^2\)</span> has a well-defined inverse of <span class="process-math">\(g^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{h} \mathbb{R}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=x^2\)</span> does <em class="emphasis">not</em> have a well-defined inverse.  We can't ever recover the negative values after squaring them.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{k} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k(x)=x^2\)</span> also does <em class="emphasis">not</em> have a well-defined inverse.  Limiting the codomain to the produced outputs doesn't change the fact that we're losing sign information through the map.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(l(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}\)</span> feels like a trick question. For most  intents and purposes, we <em class="emphasis">should</em> have <span class="process-math">\(l^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{x}-1\)</span> but the domain and codomain don't look right here.  Specifically, we have a problem where <span class="process-math">\(l^{-1}(0)\)</span> is undefined and another problem where <span class="process-math">\(l^{-1}(x) &lt; 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x &gt; 1\text{.}\)</span> Based on these observations, I'd have to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> is not invertable.</div></li>
</ol> <div class="para">Having still not entirely convinced myself these are correct, I thought it might be helpful to look at the graphs. I started with the first pair to make sure its what I expected.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article2-ex4-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.1.5<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Comparison of graphs for Article II, Exercise 4.1</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">One of the way's I think of my inverse function is as "a reflection over the line <span class="process-math">\(x=y\)</span>".  This works nicely for a visual confirmation because I can tell that this relationship will hold for the rest of the lines.  My confidence in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}\)</span> being invertible is very high.</div> <div class="para">Now let's take a look at the relation between <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x}\text{:}\)</span>
</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article2-ex4-2.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.1.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Comparison of graphs for Article II, Exercise 4.2-4.4</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Notice how the inverse function only replicates half of the parabola when reflected over the diagonal. My justification for thinking that (2) is an isomorphism but (3) and (4) are not is that every point in the domain needs to have an inverse that these can be matched up with a point in the codomain (both "onto" and "one-to-one").  By including negative numbers in our domain, we're essentially allowing un-invertable points to be passed in.</div> <div class="para">Now let's take a look at the final functions:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article2-ex4-3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.1.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Comparison of graphs for Article II, Exercise 4.5</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">On the surface, this looks like precisely the function we're looking for.  It looks like a pretty good "mirror image".  The problem comes when consider the domain and codomain.  The map <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> is only valid for positive values, so let's crop and zoom in our previous graph.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article2-ex4-4.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.1.8<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Cropped and zoomed graph for Article II, Exercise 4.5</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Notice how the graph of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{x}-1\)</span> seemingly has an asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and gets "cut-off" when it hits the x-axis.  For us to consider this as an inverse map, the domain of the inverse should match the codomain of the map and vice versa.  Even though these maps meet my reflection criteria, the fact that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l^{-1}} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> is undefined for <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x &gt; 1\)</span> when domain and codomain are supposed to both be <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\)</span> disqualifies it from being considered an inverse to the map <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \xrightarrow{l} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Perhaps what I should really be doing is looking at the compositions.  We can express <span class="process-math">\(l \circ l^{-1}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{x}-1)+1}\)</span> or we can express <span class="process-math">\(l^{-1} \circ l\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{x+1})}-1\text{.}\)</span>  These expressions both simplify to just <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> but the holes left in the map when we divide by zero at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> don't just disappear.</div>
