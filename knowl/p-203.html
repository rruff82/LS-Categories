<div class="para">It turns out that last week’s lack of exercises wasn’t as much of an anomaly as I thought it was. After realizing that this week’s session didn’t have any exercises either, I scanned ahead and noticed that there are several sessions like this before eventually reaching a "Quiz" and "Test". I’m not sure how I plan to handle those yet, but I think I’m going to keep with my chill pace for now.  This session did include several side questions throughout that I can treat as I would the exercises.</div>
