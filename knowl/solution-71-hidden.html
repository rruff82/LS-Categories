<div class="para">First, let's formulate our definition with a diagram:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img-article3-ex16-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.3.4<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Structure preserving maps on reflexive graphs?</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Where this gets interesting is when we look at all possible paths we can follow between <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> in addition to the ones between <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  To follow the pattern of the previous categories, we'd need to enforce all 3 of the following:</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle f_D s = s' f_A\)</span></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle f_D t = t' f_A\)</span></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle f_A i = i' f_D\)</span></div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">The order of that last one seems a little bit tricky since our retraction <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is heading in the opposite direction.  At the same time, this map <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is presicely what allows us to "solve" for <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(f_A\text{.}\)</span> In Exercise 15, we saw that this <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> only works if there's an arrow forming a "self-loop" at each point. All our map <span class="process-math">\(f_D\)</span> needs to do is match up the self-looping arrows on each point in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> with the corresponding self-looping arrows on <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Let's suppose we use the common section <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> on a point <span class="process-math">\(p \in P\)</span> to produce some arrow <span class="process-math">\(x = i p \in X\text{.}\)</span> It follows that this arrow <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> needs to form a self-loop such that <span class="process-math">\(s x = t x = p\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(s i = 1_P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t i = 1_P\)</span> imply <span class="process-math">\(s \circ x = s \circ i \circ p = 1_P \circ p = p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t \circ x = t \circ i \circ p = 1_P \circ p = p\)</span> respectively. We can then pair that point with a corresponding self-looping arrow <span class="process-math">\(f_A(x) = y \in Y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(s'(y) = t'(y) = q\text{.}\)</span> We know such a loop needs to exist because <span class="process-math">\(f_D s x = s' f_A x = s' y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_D t x = t' f_A x = t' y\)</span> would need to satisfy <span class="process-math">\(f_D s x = f_D t x\text{.}\)</span> Finally, we can put this all together to define <span class="process-math">\(f_D p = s' f_A i p = t' f_A i p = q\)</span> over all possible points in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I feel like there's probably an easier way to demonstrate this using contradiction.</div> <div class="para">Suppose for a minute that there did exist some point <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> which satistfies <span class="process-math">\(f_D(p) \neq (s' \circ f_A \circ i)(p)\text{.}\)</span>  You could use the structure preserving criteria of <span class="process-math">\(f_A i = i' f_D\)</span> to establish that <span class="process-math">\(f_D(p) \neq (s' \circ i' \circ f_D)(p)\text{.}\)</span>  Since we also know <span class="process-math">\(s' i' = 1_Q\text{,}\)</span> that previous equation simplifies down to <span class="process-math">\(f_D(p) \neq (1_Q \circ f_D)(p)\text{,}\)</span> which directly contradicts the identity property of <span class="process-math">\(1_Q\text{.}\)</span> Our assumption must therefore be false and <span class="process-math">\(f_D = s' \circ f_A \circ i\text{.}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">QED</em>.</div>
