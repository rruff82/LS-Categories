<div class="para">Suppose there was such a path from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> We could think of this path as another "endomap" on some subset of the dots <span class="process-math">\(P \subset G\)</span> on our graph forming our "path". We can identify some <span class="process-math">\(P \xrightarrow{\beta} P\)</span> with the propery that each application of map takes us one step along that path from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> until we arrive and stay there. In otherwords, we have a sequence of points <span class="process-math">\(b \rightarrow \beta b
\rightarrow \beta^2 b \rightarrow ... \rightarrow \beta^n b = e\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of nodes we traverse. We can also use this to define a reverse path by swapping the source and target of each arrow to produce an inverse map <span class="process-math">\(\beta^{-1}\)</span> that traverses these points in the opposite order: <span class="process-math">\(e \rightarrow \beta^{-1} e \rightarrow
\beta^{-2} e \rightarrow ... \rightarrow \beta^{-n} e = b\text{.}\)</span> However, note that the arrows of <span class="process-math">\(\beta^{-1}\)</span> might not necessarily exist in the original graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
