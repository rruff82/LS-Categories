<div class="para">If all points in <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are fixed, that implies a splitting of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\text{.}\)</span> If no points in <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are fixed, that also implies a splitting of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has both fixed and non-fixed points, that implies a splitting of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span>  Since there is no isomorphism between <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{,}\)</span> we use the result of Session 9 Exercise 3 to infer that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can’t be split by both of them simultaneously.  If our <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has both fixed and non-fixed points, the set of fixed points would preserve an isomorphism with <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> — meaning that the point fixed by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> would necessarily be unique. Likewise, each non-fixed point <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> needs to exists as part of a pair with some <span class="process-math">\(f y\)</span> to preserve the isomorphism between <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{y,fy\}\text{.}\)</span>
