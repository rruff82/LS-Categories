<div class="para">For (b) we need to prove the converse.  Suppose we have some path from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P \subset G\text{.}\)</span>  If we think of that path as an endomap <span class="process-math">\(\beta: P \rightarrow P\)</span> as described above, then that endomap must have a fixed point <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> *somewhere*. That point obviously can’t be <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(\beta b = b\)</span> contradicts our notion of a path.  Likewise, it couldn’t fix any <span class="process-math">\(\beta^n b\)</span> along the path either, so the only reasonable fixed point would be <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span>  As before, <span class="process-math">\(P^{\circlearrowright \beta} \xrightarrow{f} J^{\circlearrowright \gamma}\)</span> would need to preserve the structure of both possible endomaps on <span class="process-math">\(J\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma = 1_J\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = \gamma f = f\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(\beta = 1_P\)</span> which contradicts <span class="process-math">\(\beta b \neq b\text{.}\)</span>  If <span class="process-math">\(\forall j \in J: \gamma j = 0\)</span> , then that contradicts our condition that <span class="process-math">\(f \beta = \gamma f\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(f \beta e = f e = 1\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\gamma f e = \gamma 1 = 0\text{.}\)</span>
